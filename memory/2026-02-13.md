## Graph Extraction (02:00 UTC)
- NLP enrichment completed — processed unprocessed messages from today's session
- Graph improvements: timed out (may need manual run)
- **Graph stats:** 597 entities, 9 relations, 991 facts
- Key extractions: Chimera architecture refs, service health facts, timeline data

## Neil Alden Tax AI Project (New!)
- **Started:** 09:42 UTC
- **Target:** Neil Alden Advocacia Tributária (Brazilian tax boutique, 13+ offices)
- **Contact:** Otto knows someone at their Curitiba office
- **MVP deadline:** Feb 20 (1 week)
- **Deal structure:** Equity/long-term AI partnership
- **MVP scope:** "Parecer Tributário Inteligente" — RAG-powered tax opinion assistant
  - Smart client intake questionnaire
  - Treaty (DTA) analysis with LOB/PPT decision trees
  - Draft tax opinion generation with citations
  - PDF export
  - All in Portuguese
- **Dashboard:** Project + goal + 10 tasks created on kira-dashboard
- **Corpus status:** PDFs from Receita Federal are scanned (no text extraction possible). Pivoted to scraping decree text from planalto.gov.br. Sub-agent working on it.
- **Key insight:** The AI-generated research PDFs Otto sent show the attorney already understands the problem deeply — we're selling execution, not concept.

## Neil Alden MVP - Major Milestone
- **Full E2E pipeline working!** Questionnaire → Treaty Analysis → RAG Search → LLM Generation → PDF Export
- Generation produces 4,600 char professional pareceres in ~80s (search + qwen3:14b)
- Streaming SSE endpoint works — tokens appear in real time in the UI
- PDF export: 2-page professional A4 documents
- **Root cause of failed generations**: qwen2.5-coder:14b was being loaded by NLP graph layer, eating all GPU. Fixed by switching to granite3.3:2b.
- Server now managed via PM2 (`pm2 restart neil-alden`)
- Remaining: UI polish, test with more scenarios, pitch deck

## CRITICAL INCIDENT: Dashboard crash locked Otto out
- **Cause**: Used `displayMsgs` (undefined) instead of `msgs` in renderScratchMessages
- **Impact**: All JS crashed, no tab navigation, no chat, no content
- **Telegram also broken**: voice-interceptor was conflicting with OpenClaw's getUpdates polling
- **Recovery**: Otto had to message Nova agent to fix things
- **Lesson**: ALWAYS test UI changes before committing. Never reference vars that don't exist. Voice interceptor approach (dual polling) is fundamentally broken — need webhook or skill-based approach instead.
