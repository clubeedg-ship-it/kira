# 2026-02-10 — Massive Infrastructure Day

## Memory System Built
- Created unified.db: 413 entities, 665 relations, 1280 facts
- Fixed critical schema.sql DROP TABLE bug (was destroying summaries/decisions/preferences every curator run)
- Installed nomic-embed-text for vector search
- Created ~/kira/scripts/memory/index.js CLI (search/log/recall/maintain/status/embed)
- Populated memory from ALL 40 session transcripts using 3 parallel Opus agents
- Ran focused graph enrichment pass: corporate hierarchy, cross-company links, tech stack, investors, competitors
- Deduped 206 duplicate entities, cleaned 143 noise entities
- memory_search (OpenClaw built-in) still broken — needs API keys for embeddings provider

## Kira Command Center Dashboard (port 3847)
- Built v2 with 6 pages: Morning Brief, Tasks, Goals, Knowledge Graph, Chat, VDR Documents
- Tasks: kanban + table toggle, priority colors, company tags, filters, click-to-expand details
- Goals: NOW pulls live from Notion (95 goals), grouped by level (Vision/6-Month/3-Month/1-Month/Weekly)
- Knowledge Graph: D3.js force-directed graph from unified.db, click→sidebar with facts
- Chat: Telegram-like bidirectional sync via chat-sync-daemon
- VDR: File browser with markdown rendering
- live_animation feature ported: <live_animation> tags in chat generate interactive HTML via OpenRouter/Gemini
- Persistent page navigation (localStorage), cache-busting, keyboard shortcuts (g+b/t/g/k/c/d)
- Fixed: static file path bug, CSS overflow for lists in chat, cache-control headers

## Notion Fixed
- CRITICAL BUG FOUND: Was querying wrong DB ID (302a6c94) instead of correct (300a6c94-88ca-81c7-be95-e0f0433b6f58)
- Fixed ALL references in scripts/workflows/notion-ids.json, living-vdr-agent.js, dashboard server
- Created 29 new tasks via VDR agent execute phase
- Linked 57 tasks to goals in Goal Cascade
- Correct IDs: Tasks=300a6c94-88ca-81c7-be95-e0f0433b6f58, Goals=2fba6c94-88ca-8102-afb2-cae874f281bd, Companies=300a6c94-88ca-8143-8ada-e3fc640db447

## Otto's Visa Research
- Full report at ~/kira/vdr/otto-entrepreneur-visa-research.md
- Plan: Leave NL by car to non-Schengen → fly to Brazil (May 2026) → Argentina → return with entrepreneur visa
- Budget needed: €33K-50K, 90-point IND scoring system, 90% rejection rate
- CRITICAL: Must consult immigration lawyer before leaving (overstay risk)
- 16 tasks loaded into dashboard with due dates Feb-Nov 2026
- MVV application from São Paulo consulate, ~90 days processing

## Victor Taelin's Worklog Concept
- Tweet from today: built hourly check-in tool for his team (HigherOrderCO)
- Every hour: "What are you working on?" → 4-5 words → timeline Gantt view
- Solves 99% of management pain at 1% overhead (5 min/day)
- Otto wants this built for our system — hourly Telegram check-ins + timeline dashboard page
- Perfect fit: Otto + Kira + sub-agents as "team members"

## Technical Notes
- Dashboard runs via PM2 as kira-dashboard (server-v2.js)
- chat-sync-daemon on PM2 handles bidirectional Telegram↔Dashboard sync
- OpenRouter key for live_animation: in server-v2.js
- Notion integration name: "Clawd" (old name, still works)
- Embedding job was kicked off but status unknown (nomic-embed-text)
- Context hit 49% during session — curator recommended
