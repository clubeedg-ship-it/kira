# 2026-02-08 — Night Shift Deep Work + Weekly Strategy

## Weekly Executive Advisor Briefing (05:00 UTC)
- Sent strategic briefing to Otto via Telegram
- Key message: Last week was 100% infrastructure, 0% revenue. Must flip this week.
- Recommended parking SentinAgro, CuttingEdge maintenance-only, no Chimera code this week
- ONE MOVE: Get first paying OttoGen client
- Honest $1B assessment: <1% by Oct, realistic €5-15M portfolio. Reframe as foundation-building.
- Notion databases still not shared with integration — can't create tasks programmatically
- TODO: Ask Otto to share Goals and Tasks DBs with Notion integration

## Session: Kira Night Shift (01:34-03:00 UTC)

### Deliverables Produced

1. **billion-dollar-math.md** — Brutal reality check on $1B target
   - $1B by Oct 2026: <1% probability 
   - Realistic 8-month target: €5-60M portfolio valuation
   - Only Chimera has a path to massive valuation (and it needs 2-3 years)
   - Priority order: OttoGen (cash) → IAM (revenue) → ZenithCred (funding) → Chimera (the bet)

2. **strategic-roadmap-2026.md** — Month-by-month Feb-Oct plan
   - Feb: First OttoGen revenue (5 clients)
   - Mar: Pipeline building, IAM pilot
   - Apr-May: ZenithCred seed closes
   - Jun-Jul: Chimera testnet
   - Aug-Oct: Chimera seed round
   - 5 highest-leverage moves identified

3. **Company Deep Strategies (7 files):**
   - iam-deep-strategy.md — NL kindergarten market (~9-11K locations), lease economics, partnership strategy
   - zenithcred-deep-strategy.md — Seed round strategy, investor prep, market entry
   - ottogen-deep-strategy.md — First €1K plan, 20 SMBs to DM, delivery model
   - chimera-deep-strategy.md — Open source launch plan, VC pitch, community building, Nillion comps
   - cuttingedge-deep-strategy.md — Recommendation: MAINTENANCE ONLY
   - sentinagro-deep-strategy.md — Recommendation: PARKED
   - kira-ops-deep-strategy.md — Recommendation: Internal capability, not a product yet

4. **pipeline-tracker-design.md** — Google Sheets tracker design spec

### Notion Updates
- 7 strategy docs pushed to VDR page as child pages
- Goals/Tasks databases NOT accessible to integration (need to be shared)
- VDR page ID: 300a6c94-88ca-81a8-a882-eb76ba812d7e

### Key Research Findings
- AI startup valuations 2025-26: Seed ~$10M, Series A ~$45.7M, Series B ~$150-200M
- AI revenue multiples: 10-50x (seed ~19.6x, Series A ~31.9x)
- Nillion (closest Chimera comp): $400M Series A valuation, $750M FDV at token launch
- Corporate wellness market Europe: ~$23.6B by 2030, 3% CAGR
- AI agents market: $7.6B in 2025, projected $183B by 2033 (49.6% CAGR)
- Netherlands kindergarten locations: ~9,000-11,000 kinderdagverblijf

### Critical Insight for Otto
**The $1B goal needs to be reframed.** Not "hit $1B by October" but "build the foundation by October that makes $1B achievable by 2028." The math doesn't lie. Focus on: (1) cash flow now, (2) seed rounds, (3) Chimera community, (4) team building.
