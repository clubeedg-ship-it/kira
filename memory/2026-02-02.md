# 2026-02-02 — Phase 3 Activation ⚡

## Summary
Otto activated Phase 3 of Chimera. Built the Pipeline module and sub-agent integration in one session.

## What We Built

### Pipeline Module (`src/pipeline/`)
- End-to-end request processing: Message → Memory → Classification → Job → Execution
- Memory Graph integration for context retrieval
- Smart job classification (search, create, analyze, summarize)
- Keyword extraction with stopword removal
- Job tickets written to VDR for visibility

### Sub-Agent Integration
- **ClawdbotExecutor** - File-based communication for sub-agents
- **processForSpawn()** - Returns spawn task compatible with sessions_spawn
- **process-request.js** - Integration script for Clawdbot
- **chimera report** - CLI command for sub-agents to report results

### Test Coverage
- Started: 298 tests
- Fixed: 2 analyzer tests
- Added: 17 pipeline tests
- Final: **315 tests passing**

## Key Commands
```bash
# Process a request
chimera process "Search for docs"

# Process and get spawn task
node ~/chimera/scripts/process-request.js "Build X" --spawn --user=otto

# Report sub-agent result
chimera report <jobId> "Result text"
```

## Git Commits
- `fix: adjust analyzer test strings for proper fuzzy matching`
- `docs: add TODO.md with next phase plan`
- `feat: add Pipeline for end-to-end request processing (Phase 3)`
- `docs: update TODO with Phase 3 progress`
- `feat: add ClawdbotExecutor for sub-agent spawning`

## Remaining for Full Demo
- Actually call sessions_spawn from Kira when processing requests
- Route results back to Telegram
- Test full loop: Otto → Kira → Sub-agent → Result → Otto

## System Health
- Gateway stable (pid 89422)
- All heartbeat checks passing
- Activity forwarding working

---
*Phase 3 core infrastructure complete. Ready for live integration.*
