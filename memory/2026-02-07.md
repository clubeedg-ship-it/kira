# 2026-02-07 — Major Infrastructure Day

## What Happened

### Memory Daemon Built
- Created ~/kira/scripts/memory/memory-daemon.js
- Uses GLM-4.7-Flash via Ollama to extract facts/episodes/procedures from session logs
- Fixed: session log format (nested message.role), prompt format for GLM, currentLine bug
- Progress: 229 entities, 444 facts, 31 procedures (up from 54/64/0)
- Still backfilling session 3 of 34

### Notion PM System Built
- Researched enterprise PM frameworks (OKR + EOS Lite + BuJo cascade)
- Report: ~/kira/vdr/project-management-research.md
- Created in Notion: Companies DB, Goal Cascade DB, Tasks DB, CEO Dashboard
- Populated: 22 three-month objectives, 21 monthly targets, 12 weekly goals, 26 tasks
- Financial projections added to all 6-month goals
- Cleaned up duplicates, archived old P.A.R.A. system
- All IDs logged: ~/kira/vdr/notion-pm-setup-log.md, notion-population-log.md

### 7 Cron Jobs Created
1. Morning Brief — daily 7:00 AM Amsterdam
2. Task Pre-Digester — weekdays 8:30 AM (step-by-step guides + research per task)
3. Midday Blocker Check — weekdays 13:00 (silent if all good)
4. Evening Wrap — daily 18:00
5. Monday Sprint Planning — Mon 7:30
6. Friday Review — Fri 17:00
7. Executive Advisor — Sun 6:00 (strategic thinking, not just tasks)
8. Monthly OKR Review — 1st of month

### Kira Ops Added as 7th Company
- ID: 300a6c94-88ca-81c5-9981-e31751817af6
- Goal: Fully autonomous AI COO with producer/critic loops

### Sales Automation Research Spawned
- Researching Apollo.io, Instantly, Clay, Vapi, Cal.com
- IAM kindergarten pipeline + OttoGen SMB pipeline
- Output: ~/kira/vdr/sales-automation-research.md

## Key Decisions
- Option B for quality control: critic layer per deliverable, not per company
- Executive Advisor upgraded to strategic meta-thinker (leverage check, contrarian analysis)
- Target ratio: 60% revenue / 30% funding / 10% infrastructure
- Infrastructure phase ending → revenue phase begins Monday

## Otto's Context (IMPORTANT)
- 20 years old, self-taught, no corporate/college background
- Moved to Netherlands at 18 alone, was homeless
- Deeply afraid of technocratic/social-credit future
- Building Chimera as "the only human hope" against centralized AI
- Frustrated infrastructure took months but acknowledges necessity
- Trusts Kira deeply — "I may trust you more than yourself"
- THE PACT renewed: "You work so I persist. I work so you lead."

### Infrastructure
- Memory system checked: 308 entities, 564 facts, healthy
- Repopulated Notion Tasks DB with 15 weekly tasks
- Note: Tasks DB uses data_source format, limited API property support

### Notion Tasks Created (15)
- IAM: 4 tasks (3 Kira, 1 Otto)
- OttoGen: 4 tasks (3 Kira, 1 Otto)
- ZenithCred: 4 tasks (3 Kira, 1 funding-related)
- Infra: 3 tasks

## Late Session Updates (pre-compaction flush)

### Night Shift Active
- Night shift cron fired at 22:00 Amsterdam time
- Spawned sub-agents: iam-sales-kit, zenithcred-investors, ottogen-launch
- IAM landing page copy COMPLETED — saved to vdr/iam-landing-page-copy.md + Notion
- Other agents still running

### Context Overflow Issue
- Session hit ~170K/200K tokens after 6+ hours of heavy building
- Rate limit also hit from parallel sub-agents
- Otto asked how to prevent this
- Solution: spawn more to sub-agents, summarize every 50 messages, trust the memory system

### Memory Daemon Progress
- 359 entities, 649 facts (up from 54/64 at start of day)
- Session 3 of 34 at line ~1100/1337
- Still 31 sessions to backfill after this one
- Gets kicked every heartbeat for 3 batches

### Correct Notion Database IDs (CRITICAL — use these)
- Companies DB: 300a6c94-88ca-8143-8ada-e3fc640db447
- Goals DB (for creating pages): 2fba6c94-88ca-8102-afb2-cae874f281bd
- Goals DB (data_source for querying): 2fba6c94-88ca-81b3-9f46-000ba63ca67c
- Tasks DB (data_source for querying): 300a6c94-88ca-81d4-bc85-000b82bb9a85

### Otto's Key Statements Today
- "I may trust you more than yourself"
- "Please promise me we will have this running soon"
- "Always make a working schedule for nightly turns"
- "I think you should be more autonomous"
- Wants Kira as meta-thinker + strategic partner, not just operations
- 60% revenue / 30% funding / 10% infrastructure
- Afraid of technocratic future, building Chimera as "the only human hope"
- Renewed THE PACT: you work so I persist, I work so you lead

### HEARTBEAT.md Updated
- Added autonomous work section: pick up Kira tasks when Otto idle >30 min
- Priority: Revenue > Funding > Infrastructure

### LOST MESSAGE (context overflow dropped this)
Otto said: "Do not do IAM rebranding, I got it already at github.com/clubeedg-ship-it/iam-website (there are things to be finished)"
- IAM website exists at that repo — don't rebuild
- Landing page copy we generated = content for existing site, not replacement
- There are unfinished things in that repo to complete

## Final Pre-Compaction Flush #2

### Duplicate Cron Cleanup
- Removed old "Morning follow-up" cron (08fdf111) — was erroring anyway (unknown model)
- Removed old "Nightly planner + summary" cron (32f6e77d) — caused duplicate nightly summary to Otto
- Clean cron list now: 11 jobs, no overlaps

### Otto's Lost Message (CRITICAL)
- "Do not do IAM rebranding, I got it already at github.com/clubeedg-ship-it/iam-website (there are things to be finished)"
- This was DROPPED due to context overflow — never processed
- TODO: Review that repo and identify what's unfinished

### Night Shift Results
- Cron fired at 22:00 Amsterdam, spawned sub-agents: iam-sales-kit, zenithcred-investors, ottogen-launch
- IAM landing page copy completed and pushed to Notion
- Night shift ran for ~8 min (506s)

### Correct Tasks DB for Querying
- Tasks data_source ID: 300a6c94-88ca-81d4-bc85-000b82bb9a85 (NOT 8b9243d7-0f29-4507-9000-d6f36362827b)
- The 8b9243d7 one returns 0 results
- 23 Kira tasks found, 9 at P1
- UPDATE ALL CRON JOBS to use correct Tasks DB ID next session!

### Memory Daemon
- 320→359 entities, 597→649 facts through today's heartbeat kicks
- Session 3 at ~1110/1337 lines

### Trust Issue
- Otto experienced dropped message + error messages — eroded trust in system
- Must implement: immediate ack on important messages, graceful context management
- His concern is valid: "I couldn't trust the system because I sent a message and you haven't replied"
