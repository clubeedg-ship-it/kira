A background task "abura-sales-critic" just completed successfully.

Findings:
**Critique complete.** Written to `~/kira/vdr/abura-cosmetics-sales-research-CRITIQUE.md`

**Key findings:**

🔴 **Confidence Score: 4/10**

**Critical issues identified:**
- **Hallucinated claims**: "Award-Worthy" in email template with no awards mentioned; competitor channel data unverified
- **Unrealistic B2B timelines**: "10+ partnerships in 6 months" is fantasy—industry average is 6-12 months for ONE major retail deal
- **Product-market fit gap**: ...

🤖 **Abura Critic done** ⚠️ — Score: 4/10. Harsh but useful: hallucinated "award-worthy" claims, unrealistic timeline (10+ partnerships in 6 months is fantasy—industry takes 6-12 months for ONE deal), and product sizes won't work for spas (need 250ml+, not 100ml). Needs to be treated as brainstorm, not executable strategy. Will fix in reconciliation.

👤 A background task "zenithcred-cfo-critic" just completed successfully.

Findings:
Done. Critical review written to `~/kira/vdr/zenithcred-business-model-CRITIQUE.md`.

## Summary of Findings

**Overall Confidence Score: 4/10** — Not investor-ready.

### Critical Issues Found:

1. **Revenue math is wrong** — Year 1 claims €345K but the monthly ramp in the appendix shows ~€162K. This is a 2x overstatement that contradicts itself within the document.

2. **"Experienced team (assumption)"** — This is literally an unfilled placeholder. No founder bios exist.

3. **Market size misdirection** — Cite...

🤖 **CFO Critic done** ⚠️ — Score: 4/10. Found revenue math that contradicts itself (€345K claimed vs €162K in appendix), fantasy LTV assumptions (6.67 years for pre-revenue product), and zero customer validation. If corrected: seed needs €1.1M not €850K, break-even pushes to month 38.

**All 3 critics complete:**
- ZenithCred CFO: 4/10
- ZenithCred CMO: 5/10

The adversarial process worked — found real hallucinations and math errors. Now spawning reconciliation agents to rebuild with corrections:

I've written the corrected strategy to `~/kira/vdr/abura-cosmetics-sales-research-v2.md`

**Key fixes made:**

🤖 **Abura V2 done** ✅ — Now realistic: 12-month timeline, 3-5 accounts in 6 months (not 10+), three budget tiers (€2-5K bootstrap to €30-50K full), and flagged that 100ml bottles won't work for spa treatments. At `~/kira/vdr/abura-cosmetics-sales-research-v2.md`.

🤖 Already skipped it — waiting on your omiXimo answers to continue. ⚡

👤 1. What is omiXimo? a company that i am doing a inventory system for, that retrieves sales from their email inbox and adds it to the software, so they can track stock, profitability, inventory value, etc. runs in this vm inside /omiximo-inventory. 2. What's the tech stack? Web app on top on inventree software 3. What specifically isn't syncing? Fixed costs, fixed components, both. seems like a client-side rendering. also i must make a way so we can edit a sale after it is recorded, in case the automation made something wrong. 4. Is this a caching issue or database issue? idk i am not a good so...

This connects to IAM (interactivemove.nl) which we already discussed. 

**Questions:**

1. Is this for IAM's current service or for ZenithCred corporate wellness?
2. Do you want to build custom (LangGraph) or use existing tools (Apollo, Lemlist)?

## Task Complete: omiXimo Inventory Sync Issues Fixed

### Changes Made:

**1. Fixed Sync Issue (Issues 1 & 2)**
- Made backend the **source of truth** for config
- `costConfig.init()` and `fixedComponentsConfig.init()` now:
  - **Await** backend fetch FIRST
  - Only fall back to localStorage if backend unavailable
  - Cache backend data to localStorage for offline use
- All devices now see the same config immediately on page load

**2. Added Sale Editing Feature (Issue 3)**
- ...

🤖 **omiXimo fixes done** ✅ — Sync issue fixed (backend is now source of truth, not localStorage), and sale editing feature added (pencil icon next to delete). Just needs manual testing: change config on one device, refresh another → should sync immediately. Full details in `~/omiximo-inventory/FIXES-2026-02-02.md`.

Still waiting on your IAM Email Outreach answers to continue the project review. ⚡

👤 #7 IAM - Email Outreach - this is for IAM's current service - i want the best option, maybe manually we would take months of debugging and development for something that other system already does way way better for only 0.01$ more per token. research needed - the lead source is not defined yet, we were thinking about google maps scraping looking for kindergartens and etc. - no budget for tools yet - website rebrand first, then sales

🤖 Got it — research now, execute after website rebrand (Feb 4).
