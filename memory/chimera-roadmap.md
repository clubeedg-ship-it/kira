# Chimera Roadmap

## Current Phase: Definition

Before we build, we need to define what we're building precisely.

### Immediate Tasks

1. **[ ] Complete Protocol Spec**
   - Finalize Consultant/Savant/Membrane design
   - Solve the hard problems (bootstrap, privacy on untrusted nodes, latency, economics)
   - Document in CHIMERA-PROTOCOL.md

2. **[ ] Research Prior Art**
   - Golem, Akash, Render (distributed compute)
   - Secret Network, Oasis, Nillion (private compute)
   - What worked? What failed? Why?

3. **[ ] Define MVP**
   - What's the smallest thing that proves the concept?
   - Who are the first users?
   - What can we ship in weeks, not months?

## Hard Problems to Solve

| Problem | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Bootstrap (first nodes) | ❓ Open | Need initial value before network effects kick in |
| Privacy on untrusted nodes | ❓ Open | How to guarantee blind execution? |
| Latency | ❓ Open | P2P adds overhead. Can we stay responsive? |
| Economic balance | ❓ Open | Token rewards must match compute costs |

## Future Phases

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept
- Single Consultant → Single Savant
- Local testing only
- Prove the split-brain works

### Phase 2: Distributed MVP
- Multiple nodes
- Basic token economics
- First external users (trusted testers)

### Phase 3: Public Beta
- Documentation for self-hosting
- Token distribution
- Marketing / awareness

### Phase 4: Network Effects
- Growth becomes self-sustaining
- Economic model proven
- Can't be shut down

## What We're NOT Doing

- ❌ Building a centralized service first and "decentralizing later"
- ❌ Raising VC money that comes with strings
- ❌ Moving fast and breaking things
- ❌ Promising privacy through policy instead of architecture

---

## Open Questions for Otto

- Who could be early node operators? (Trusted friends, communities?)
- What's the first use case? (What Job Tickets would people actually send?)
- Token or no token? (Economic model vs. simplicity)
- Timeline pressure? (When do we need revenue?)
