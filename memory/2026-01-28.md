## Evening Session - Omiximo Inventory Fixes

### SKU Field for Fixed Components
- Fixed components now include SKU field for email automation compatibility
- Components properly sync across computers via backend

### Stock Restoration for InvenTree Orders
- Added fallback stock restoration for orders imported from InvenTree
- Stock is now properly returned when deleting sales orders from UI
- Addresses issue where deleting orders didn't restore inventory

### InvenTree Integration Findings
- Confirmed 16 sales orders exist in InvenTree (system working)
- Frontend auth timing issue: SO fetch happens before auth completes
- Workaround: Clear localStorage and refresh to load all orders

### Commits
- `Fix: Add SKU to fixed components + stock restoration for InvenTree orders`
