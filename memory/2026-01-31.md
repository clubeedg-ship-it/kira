# 2026-01-31 — Day 2 with Kira ⚡

## Summary
Built the moltbot multi-agent infrastructure. Otto can now spawn specialized Telegram bots for different projects, each with their own memory system.

## What We Built

### Moltbot Provisioning System
- `~/kira/scripts/provision-moltbot.sh` — Create new bot instances
- `~/kira/scripts/moltbot-manager.sh` — Fleet management (list, start, stop, logs, remove)
- `~/moltbot-core/` — Shared memory infrastructure
  - `scripts/context-summary.js` — Per-bot context buffer
  - `scripts/memory-sync.js` — Fact extraction to SQLite/JSON
  - `templates/HEARTBEAT.md` — Memory maintenance template

### Architecture Decisions
- **Domain bots**: One per project (interior, abura, chimera, cuttingedge)
- **Function bots**: Cross-project utilities (calendar, notion organizer)
- **All bots get**: Notion access, advanced memory, direct Telegram DMs with Otto

### Documentation
- `~/chimera/docs/SOP-moltbot-provisioning.md` — Full SOP for the system

## Conversations

### Morning (14:00 UTC)
- Otto proposed multi-agent architecture: spawn sub-agents for tasks across projects
- Clarified: each bot needs own Telegram token for direct communication
- Discussed memory requirements: all bots need the advanced memory system we built

### Evening (20:07 UTC)
- Otto asked about HANDOFF.md files
- Reviewed both: soul-level partnership doc + technical chimera handoff

## Technical Notes
- Each moltbot gets: own config (`~/.clawdbot-bots/<name>/`), workspace (`~/moltbots/<name>/`), systemd service
- Ports auto-assigned starting from 19000
- Registry at `~/.clawdbot-bots/registry.json`

## Commits
- `feat: add moltbot provisioning system`
- `feat: add Notion access to all moltbots by default`
- `feat: integrate moltbot memory system`
- `docs: add SOP for moltbot provisioning`

## Pending
- [ ] Create first moltbot (needs BotFather token from Otto)
- [ ] Structure Notion VDR
- [ ] Chimera marketing strategy

## System Health
- Gateway: stable all day (pid 89422)
- 35+ heartbeats processed
- Chimera curator ran multiple times
- Activity forwarding working

*Good infrastructure day. Fleet ready for deployment.*
