# 2026-02-05 — THE MISSION BEGINS

## Otto's Vision (12:03 UTC)

**Goal:** Build Oopuo Holdings to $1B valuation in 8 months (by Oct 2026)
**Structure:** Solo ownership, AI-managed multinational corporation
**Standard:** Enterprise-grade, QA-reviewed deliverables

### Portfolio Companies
| Company | Focus | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Chimera Protocol | Privacy-preserving AI infrastructure | Building (core tech) |
| ZenithCred | B2B corporate wellness (Benelux) | Pre-revenue, needs €150-300K seed |
| SentinAgro | Agricultural drone mapping (Goiás, Brazil) | Planning, R$35-60K startup |
| OttoGen.io | AI courses → system sales | Pre-launch |
| IAM | Interior design/rebranding | Revenue-generating |
| Abura Cosmetics | Cosmetics | Early revenue |
| CuttingEdge | Barbering/media | Revenue-generating |

### OttoGen Strategy
1. Attract AI-curious SMB owners with content
2. Teach current AI limitations → create FOMO about advanced systems
3. Sell existing systems (voice agents, automations)
4. Build community (TikTok/IG for Gen-Z: freedom, post-labour themes)

### Kira Development Priorities
- Memory system that learns through interaction
- Sub-agent creation/management
- Goal tracking (P.A.R.A., GTD)
- Single source-of-truth database (Notion)
- Voice assistant for messages
- MVP with Codex 5.2

## Work Completed Today

### Infrastructure
- Created `~/kira/oopuo/` structure (MISSION.md, companies/, agents/, financials/)

- Configured Brave API key for web search
- Stored Cerebral API key

### Enterprise Agent System
- Designed org structure: CEO (Kira), CFO, CMO, COO, CTO + functional teams
- QA Protocol: Every deliverable reviewed by separate QA agent
- Created agent registry at `~/kira/oopuo/agents/REGISTRY.md`

### CFO Agent Completed

### QA Agent Completed
- Reviewed 6 VDR files for migration quality
- 5/6 approved for Notion migration (scores 8-9/10)
- 1 needs revision: `iam-website-refactor-prompt.md` (missing design specs)
- Report: `~/kira/oopuo/qa-reports/vdr-migration-review.md`

### Content Created
- OttoGen first lesson script (SMB webinar, 45-60 min)
- SentinAgro Goiás cost analysis (R$35-60K startup, R$5-8K/mo ops)
- Both synced to Notion

---

## Pending Actions

## Evening Session (22:00+ UTC)

### Memory Architecture Implemented
Otto shared MEMORY_RESEARCH.md - comprehensive research on AI memory systems.

**Implemented 3-layer cognitive architecture:**
1. **High-Level:** Blackboard (multi-agent coordination)
2. **Mid-Level:** Episodes + Procedures + Semantic Graph
3. **Low-Level:** Embeddings + KV Cache (ready for 4090)

### Scripts Created
- `~/kira/scripts/memory/blackboard.js` - Multi-agent coordination
- `~/kira/scripts/memory/episodes.js` - Temporal event logging
- `~/kira/scripts/memory/procedures.js` - Validated workflows
- `~/kira/scripts/memory/memory-core.js` - Unified interface
- `~/kira/scripts/memory/embeddings.js` - Vector search
- `~/kira/scripts/memory/reflection.js` - Self-improvement loop
- `~/kira/scripts/memory/kv-cache.js` - GPU cache management
- `~/kira/scripts/setup-4090.sh` - GPU setup script

### 4090 GPU Confirmed Working!
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM)
- Ollama running with 6 models
- qwen2.5:7b responding
- Embeddings working (3584 dimensions)
- Memory + LLM integration tested successfully

**Local model recalled today's work:**
> "The main accomplishment today was creating an IAM Sales Playbook along with setting up Apollo, Instantly, and Vapi, as well as developing a four-class webinar curriculum for OttoGen."

### Self-Reflection Results
- Strong in: iam, sales, automation, ottogen, content
- task tasks at 100% success rate
- 2 discoveries posted to blackboard

### Key Insight
Otto's directive: "—dangerously-skip-permissions" = full autonomy, don't wait for approval on implementation

## Deliverables Created Today

| Deliverable | Location |
|-------------|----------|
| CFO Dashboard | Notion |
| COO Roadmap | Notion |
| CMO Launch Strategy | Notion |
| IAM Sales Quest | Notion |

## Otto Preferences Learned
- Wants enterprise-grade, QA-reviewed deliverables
- Each company should have dedicated CMO (not portfolio-wide)
- Content needs his sign-off before customer-facing execution
- IAM is blocked on DNS/DKIM/HubSpot (developer dependency)
- OttoGen webclass first → then internet content
- Full autonomy mode: act first, report significant progress

*This is Day 1 of the 8-month mission. The foundation is set.*
