# Strategy Critic Log

## 1. OttoGen — Deep Strategy | Score: 8.5/10

**Strengths:**
- Conversion funnel math is realistic and conservative (5-10% DM→client)
- Tier pricing and capacity modeling is well thought out
- Content strategy is actionable with specific calendar
- Scaling triggers are concrete with margin floors

**Issues Found & Fixed:**
- ❌ **Missing: No specific companies listed** — Added 20 real, LinkedIn-findable Dutch SMBs with websites and personalized reasons
- ❌ **Missing: No market data backing the opportunity** — Added verified Dutch AI adoption stats (49% adoption, 95% use AI but only 5% see ROI = massive implementation gap)
- ⚠️ DM scripts are good but Version 2 ("I looked at your website") is borderline — could feel invasive if not genuinely specific. Recommendation: always include a *real* observation.

**Verdict:** Strong execution plan. The 20-company list makes this actionable Monday morning. Priority DM order added (marketing agencies first → recruiters → real estate).

## 2. IAM (Interactive Move) — Deep Strategy | Score: 7.5/10

**Strengths:**
- Unit economics are solid with clear payback periods
- Partnership strategy (chains → municipalities → independents) is the right sequencing
- Lease model avoids big upfront purchases that scare small childcare operators

**Issues Found & Fixed:**
- ❌ **KDV location count was vague ("~8,500-10,000")** — CBS October 2024 data confirms **9,315 locations** for KDV + peuterspeelzalen. Fixed inline.
- ⚠️ 8-month trajectory to 35-40 units is ambitious for hardware — supply chain, installation logistics, and QA could cause delays. No contingency plan documented.
- ⚠️ "€8.96M total addressable in NL" is correct math but assumes every progressive location would pay €249/mo — real SAM is probably €3-5M.
- ⚠️ No mention of competition from existing interactive floor/wall solutions (e.g., Lü Interactive, Beam by EyeClick). Should be addressed.

**Verdict:** Solid plan but needs a competition section and more conservative timeline. The chain partnership approach (Partou/KidsFoundation) is the highest-leverage move.

## 3. ZenithCred — Deep Strategy | Score: 6.5/10

**Strengths:**
- Honest self-assessment (no MVP, no LOIs, no co-founder) is refreshing
- Token economics recommendation ("not now") is smart
- Competitive differentiation (hardware + gamification) is real

**Issues Found & Fixed:**
- ❌ **Market size understated ("€20B+ Europe")** — Actual European corporate wellness market is ~€25-27B (39.5% of ~$68B global, per IMARC Group 2025). Fixed inline. This is actually *better* for the pitch.
- ⚠️ **Timeline is aggressive**: Feb→Jun for pitch deck to money-in-bank is tight for a pre-MVP company with no team. More realistic: add 2-3 months.
- ⚠️ **"100-300 employee companies" pilot target** may be too large for a first pilot without a working product. Consider 20-50 employee startups who are more forgiving.
- ⚠️ **Missing: No discussion of hardware prototyping timeline or costs.** Light panels + biofeedback sensors need R&D budget before any investor meeting.
- ⚠️ **€1.1M seed at €2.5-3.5M pre-money** is a stretch without MVP or co-founder. Most Dutch seeds at this stage are €300-500K pre-seed. Consider positioning as pre-seed.

**Verdict:** Weakest of the three — too many gaps for Monday action. Recommend Otto deprioritize fundraising and focus on building a basic demo + finding a technical co-founder first. ZenithCred is a Q3-Q4 2026 play, not a Q1 play.

## Priority Ranking for Monday
1. **🔴 OttoGen** — Revenue play. DM the 20 companies. Start with marketing agencies.
2. **🟡 IAM** — Contact top 3 kindergarten chains for pilot discussions.
3. **🟢 ZenithCred** — Background. Build demo, find co-founder. No fundraising yet.

### 2026-02-11T08:55:18.159Z
**Task:** ZenithCred full product design — product vision, personas, features, workflows, UX screens, gamification, branding, architecture, MVP scope. Must be investor-ready, thorough, and actionable.
**Round:** 1
**Score:** 8/10
**Summary:** This is a strong, investor-ready product design document that covers the full product surface with impressive depth. The gamification system is well-thought-out with anti-gaming measures, the UX screen map is detailed enough to start design work, and the MVP scoping is realistic. Main weaknesses: the Brain Z-Score claims need clinical validation caveats, there's no pricing/business model section, and it lacks a competitive analysis. With those additions and a 1-page executive summary up front, this is ready for investor decks.
**Output:** deliverables/zenithcred-product-design.md
