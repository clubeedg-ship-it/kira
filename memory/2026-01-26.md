# 2026-01-26 - Major Session: Chimera Project

## Summary
Built the foundation of **Chimera** - a self-evolving feature system for Clawdbot with Consultant/Savant architecture.

## Project Location
`~/chimera/` - Full project with TDD

## What Was Built (✅ Working)

### 1. Observer (`src/observer/`)
- Parses Clawdbot session logs from `~/.clawdbot/agents/main/sessions/`
- Extracts events (tool_error, tool_success, user_request, etc.)
- Incremental processing with checkpoints
- **13 tests passing**

### 2. Analyzer (`src/analyzer/`)
- Detects patterns from events (errors, opportunities)
- Fuzzy matching for similar errors
- Writes to `vdr/patterns/*.md`
- **10 tests passing**

### 3. Savant Creator (`src/savant-creator/`)
- Interview-based creation of new specialized bots
- Generates SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, workflow.yaml
- **5 tests passing**

### 4. Activity Feed (`src/activity/`)
- Logs savant thinking/actions
- `vdr/activity/{date}.md` + `stream.jsonl`
- Forwarding to Telegram on heartbeat

### 5. VDR Communication Protocol
```

```

### 6. CLI
```bash
chimera run              # Full pipeline
chimera status           # Show status
chimera activity watch   # Live activity stream
chimera savant create    # Create new savant
```

## What's Spec'd But Not Implemented

- **Generator** - Turn patterns into code
- **Tester** - Validate generated code
- **Deployer** - Install to Clawd
- **Meta-Thinker** - Strategic oversight
- **Error-Recovery** - Failure handling
- **Curator** - Knowledge extraction
- **Memory Graph** - SQLite + embeddings (spec at `specs/005-memory-graph.md`)

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Consultant = LOCAL model** with private data access
2. **Savant = CLAWD** for operational tasks
3. **VDR = file-based communication** (human-readable, git-trackable)
4. **One Telegram bot** for main Clawd, separate `@chimera_activity_bot` for logs
5. **TDD approach** - tests before implementation
6. **Activity feed** - all savants log their thinking

## Key Files

- `~/chimera/HANDOFF.md` - Full context handoff
- `~/chimera/specs/savant-templates.yaml` - All 9 savant definitions with VDR keys
- `~/chimera/specs/004-vdr-keys.md` - Read/write locations
- `~/chimera/specs/005-memory-graph.md` - Graph memory design

## Telegram Bots

- **Main Clawd** - Existing, conversations with Otto
- **@chimera_activity_bot** - Created but not yet connected (Otto needs to /start)
  - Token: `8238580898:AAF0aGxRFJadbspS0VEJLc5g6tH9fLpOVsQ`
  - Script: `~/chimera/src/notify/telegram.js`

## Memory Research Referenced

- **COMPASS** - Hierarchical multi-agent (Main + Meta-Thinker + Context Manager)
- **Zep/Graphiti** - Temporal Knowledge Graph
- **HippoRAG** - Hippocampus-inspired retrieval
- **GraphRAG** - Community summaries

## Otto's BOS Vision (Inspiration)

From his brainstorm:
- 16 specialized agents
- Sweet Spot Control Loop (Propose → Confirm → Execute)
- XML-structured workflows
- Error Recovery Agent
- Meta-learning loop

## Next Steps

1. Otto sends `/start` to @chimera_activity_bot
2. Implement Generator (patterns → code)
3. Implement Memory Graph (SQLite + embeddings)
4. Wire more savants as needed

## Stats

- **28 tests passing** total
- **3116 events** processed from Clawd logs
- **12 patterns** detected (mostly opportunity type)
