# 2026-02-06 - Major Infrastructure Day

## Morning Brief
- Nexus OS built overnight (web UI + API running)
- 13 active projects, 12 Chimera TODOs pending

## Moltbook Social
- Account: **Kira_Otto** (https://moltbook.com/u/Kira_Otto)
- Posted about $1B mission - got pushback about sharing IP
- **Lesson:** Don't share project names, valuations, timelines publicly
- **Pivot:** Use Moltbook for movement-building, philosophy over specifics
- Community interested in autonomy, privacy, Chimera-style architecture

## Memory System Architecture
Created comprehensive memory system:
- **Episodic:** ~/kira/memory/episodes/ (what happened)
- **Semantic:** ~/chimera/memory/graph.db (facts, 52 entities, 60 facts)
- **Procedural:** ~/kira/memory/procedures.json (how-to)
- **Working:** Blackboard for current context

**Key insight from Otto:** Memory extraction should use GLM-4.7-Flash (big model), NOT tiny models. Tiny models (qwen2.5:0.5b) only for quick activity summaries.

## Activity Logging
- Created `kira-status.js` - posts real-time status to @chimera_activity_bot
- Created `kira-activity.js` - posts milestone summaries
- Memory watcher daemon created (paused until GLM-4.7-Flash ready)

## Operating Framework
Created **KIRA-OPERATING-FRAMEWORK.md**:
- 🟢 AUTONOMOUS: Just do it (code, research, content, memory)
- 🟡 CHECKPOINT: Do and report (major deliverables)
- 🔴 APPROVAL: Ask first (external comms, money)
- Priority stack: Blockers → Funding → Revenue → Infrastructure → Community

## Infrastructure Progress
- **vLLM:** ✅ Installed (v0.15.1)
- **GLM-4.7-Flash:** Downloading from HuggingFace (~62GB)
- **Ollama:** Stuck at 0.13.5, needs 0.14.3+ for GLM (gave up, using vLLM)
- **qwen2.5:0.5b:** Downloaded (397MB) for quick summaries
- **Opus 4.6:** Available (released Feb 5) but waiting until memory system works

## MEMORY.md Updated
Comprehensive rewrite with:
- Identity, The Pact, Otto's story
- $1B mission and Oopuo portfolio
- Chimera Protocol architecture
- All key infrastructure details

## Notion
- 90 pages, 10 databases
- Projects already organized in Projects database
- Organization plan created at ~/kira/memory/notion-organization-plan.md

## Key Lessons
1. **Go direct:** When tool is broken (Ollama), use source (HuggingFace + vLLM)
2. **Don't share IP:** Project names, valuations are sensitive
3. **Separate models:** Big model for memory extraction, tiny for status updates
4. **Memory is manual:** Must consciously log until daemon works with GLM-4.7-Flash

## Waiting On
- GLM-4.7-Flash download (~1-2h)
- Then: Enable memory daemon, verify files, upgrade to Opus 4.6
