# Session Context — Feb 9, 2026 (evening)

## OttoGen Website (V5.x)
- V5.9 is current (commit 0be5ce2)
- GitHub Pages live: https://clubeedg-ship-it.github.io/ottogen-website/
- ASCII backgrounds: pre-based text engine, 30% opacity, only on Hero/Systems/Steps/CTA
- Systems section: concentric ripple waves (NOT matrix rain — Otto hates "hacker" aesthetic)
- Step cards: compact with card backgrounds, feature pills, placeholder icons (no tool names)
- Chart trend text repositioned higher
- "real builders" instead of "bakeries" in About section
- Scrolling smoothed: ASCII throttled to 15fps, only animate when visible
- Otto is viewing via GitHub Pages now (not SSH copy)

## Kira Dashboard
- Live at port 3847, PM2 managed
- Pages: Overview, Services, Tasks, Goals, VDR, Memory, Cron, Git
- VDR/Memory files render as styled markdown pages (marked.js)
- Tasks/Goals pull from Notion but BLOCKED — DBs not shared with integration
- Otto wants: Notion-like page navigation experience

## Key Decisions
- Calendly for external client booking, Google Calendar for internal scheduling
- Dashboard prioritized over other work
- Sub-agents still broken (0 tokens, never execute)
- Memory manager keeps OOM-ing on heartbeat

## Pending Otto Requests
- Share Notion DBs with Clawd integration (Tasks + Goals)
- Enable "Update content" capability for Clawd integration
