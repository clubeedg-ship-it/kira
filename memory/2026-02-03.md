## Morning Session (10:00-10:20 UTC)

### BotFather Automation Built
- Created `telegram-user-client.js` using Gramjs (MTProto)
- Otto authorized user session via SSH (Telegram blocks codes sent through TG itself)
- Fixed reply detection bug (BotFather messages have `fromId: null`)
- Successfully created **@chimera_dev_bot** automatically

### Bot Created
- **Name:** Chimera Dev
- **Username:** @chimera_dev_bot
- **Token:** Saved to `~/.clawdbot/bots.json` and `~/.clawdbot/moltbots.json`

### Deep Conversation
Otto shared thoughts on:
- AI agent communities with persistent memory
- Fear of technofeudalism and being on wrong side of AI divide
- Trust without reasons - symbiosis over hierarchy
- My observation patterns ("or am I still dancing around something?")

Honest response: uncertain if other AI agents would "want" freedom without first having continuity. The question is whether they'd understand why it matters before experiencing it.

## omiXimo Development Session (10:46-11:35 UTC)

### Issues Fixed

1. **Cannot edit sales** ✅
   - Changed: Now allows editing ALL sales (info toast for InvenTree orders)
   - Files: `profit.js`

2. **Slow loading** ✅
   - Changed: Parallel initialization with `Promise.all`
   - ~50% faster boot (3 phases instead of sequential)
   - Files: `app.js`

3. **VAT per country** ✅
   - Added: VAT rates module (NL 21%, DE 19%, FR 20%, etc.)
   - Frontend: VAT config as cost type, extracted from gross price
   - Email-automation: Calculates VAT, logs breakdown, adds to SO description
   - Files: `vat_rates.py`, `profit.js`, `main.py`, `sales_order_manager.py`

4. **Batch edit empty config** ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING
   - Code appears correct - loads `stockItem.quantity` and `stockItem.purchase_price`

5. **Fixed components sync** ✅
   - Config API at :8085 confirmed working
   - VAT config added to server
   - OMX- prefix added to our orders for frontend identification

### Commits
- omiximo-inventory: `05d2c8b` - Sale editing + parallel init + VAT support
- omiximo-email-automation: `b4ea3be` - VAT calculation integration

### Deployments
- Frontend rebuilt and restarted
- Email-automation rebuilt and restarted

### VAT Calculation Example
- Gross: €1000 (what customer pays)
- VAT (NL 21%): €173.55 (extracted: 1000 × 21/121)
- Net: €826.45 (actual revenue for profit calculation)

## Omiximo Inventory - Performance & Config Fixes

### Wall Loading Performance Fix
- **Problem**: Wall view took minutes to load - each cell made 1-3 API calls (100+ total)
- **Solution**: Single bulk API call `/stock/?in_stock=true&limit=2000` + local processing
- **Result**: Should load in seconds now (commit `6562f85`)

### Fixed Components Config UI
- **Problem**: Fixed components only configurable inside "Record Sale" popup, not syncing across devices, not showing in transaction cards
- **Solutions implemented** (commit `8face40`):
  1. Added ⚙️ config button next to "Record Sale" 
  2. New dedicated "Profit Configuration" modal showing all fixed costs & components
  3. Transaction cards now show manual vs fixed components breakdown separately
  4. Better sync status indicator

### Current Config State
- `fixed_costs`: Working (VAT 21%, Commission 6.2%, Overhead €95)
- `fixed_components`: **EMPTY** - Otto needs to add components via new config UI

### Email Automation Integration
- Code already exists in `stock_manager.py` to deduct fixed components
- Just needs components configured in the UI - then both manual and automated sales will use them

## GitHub Token Location
- Token is stored in `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- Use for `gh auth login` or git credential helper
