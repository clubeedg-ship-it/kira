## Notion Status
- Tasks DB (302a6c94) not accessible (404 — not shared with integration)
- Tasks DB (300a6c94) has tasks but no Kira-assigned filter available (Assignee field empty on all tasks)
- Recommendation: Otto should share the correct tasks DB with the Notion integration and assign tasks to Kira

## Priority Split Achieved
- Revenue: 67% (Abura emails + OttoGen LinkedIn)
- Funding: 33% (SentinAgro pitch deck)
- Infrastructure: maintenance check only

## Notes
