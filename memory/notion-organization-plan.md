# Notion Organization Plan

## Current State Analysis

**Structure:** PARA system exists (P.A.R.A. workspace page) but not fully utilized
- 64 pages live inside databases (good)
- 25 pages are nested under other pages (okay but scattered)
- 1 workspace root (P.A.R.A.)

**What's working:**
- Sales Quest gamification (Quests, Leaderboard, Achievements, Progress)
- PARA databases exist (Projects, Areas, Goals, Daily Notes)

**What's broken:**
- Project pages (Chimera, OttoGen, IAM, etc.) not connected to Projects database
- Goals/Monthly Goals seem underutilized
- Document Index may be orphaned
- 25+ pages floating under other pages instead of in databases
