# 2026-02-09 — Session Notes

## Key Events

### OpenRouter + Kimi K2.5 Configured
- Otto provided OpenRouter API key: configured in gateway config
- Sub-agents set to: Kimi K2.5 → K2 → Sonnet 4.5 fallback
- **Issue:** Sub-agents get "model not allowed" for openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5 — falls back to Opus. Need to debug why OpenClaw rejects the model despite it being in config. Model exists on OpenRouter (verified via API).
- Cost savings: ~30x cheaper ($0.50/$2.40 vs $15/$75 per M tokens)

### VDR Agent v2 Built
- New analyse/execute split architecture at `~/kira/scripts/living-vdr-agent-v2.js`
- `--analyse`: Scans 84 VDR files, classifies with BuJo signifiers, detects gaps/contradictions/stale info, generates questions
- `--execute`: Creates tasks in Notion from analysis report
- `--auto`: Both in sequence (cron uses this)
- First analysis: 511 actions, 154 questions, 170 gaps, 9 stale indicators
- Cron job updated (dc3affda) to use v2 auto mode
- Questions file: `~/kira/vdr/.vdr-questions.md`

### BuJo Signifiers — Blocked on Notion Permissions
- Notion integration can READ databases but CANNOT modify schema (PATCH returns 404)
- Can create pages, just can't add new properties to DB
- Otto needs to: notion.so/my-integrations → Clawd → Capabilities → enable "Update content"
- Properties to add: Status, Signifier, Type, Source
- VDR Agent v2 already classifies everything — just needs DB fields

### OttoGen Website V4 → V5
- V4 pushed: ASCII art + tool marquee + AI command demo + feature tabs
- Otto feedback on V4:
  - Replace terminal with **chat interface** (WhatsApp-like with rich components)
  - Steps need **rich animated visual cards** like AIFreedomHub (not just numbered circles)
  - Different positioning: we set up EXISTING tools (Apollo.io, Retell.ai, Notion) + deploy AI assistants
  - Steps should resonate with real SMB pain, not buzzwords
  - AIFreedomHub does n8n, doesn't know AI. We're fundamentally different.
- V5 sub-agent spawned (label: ottogen-v5, key: agent:main:subagent:fa5ba604-6b38-4070-8510-5eb83940526f)
- Steps: "We Map Your Chaos" → "We Wire Up Your Tools" → "Your AI Starts Working" → "We Keep It Growing"

### Git Safety Issue (Caught & Fixed)
- Accidentally committed entire ~/kira workspace to ottogen-website repo (MEMORY.md, API keys, etc.)
- Caught before push — reset the commit, added .gitignore, only pushed website files
- .gitignore now restricts to website files only

### Sub-Agent Status
- Many earlier sub-agents (command-center, ASCII art, path fixes, VDR sync) showed 0 tokens — never ran
- Likely spawned before Kimi config was in place and stalled
- Need to investigate why sub-agents aren't starting reliably

## Pending Items
- Fix OpenRouter model routing for sub-agents
- Notion "Update content" permission from Otto
- Monitor V5 sub-agent completion
- SentinAgro trip ~May (not parked)
- Abura blockers still need Otto's input

### Night Shift (21:00 UTC)
- ✅ Cron audit: 12 jobs all healthy, cron list API timing out (gateway WS issue)
- ✅ ZenithCred investor email sequence: 4-email cold outreach drafted
- ✅ IAM landing page copy: Full 7-section page, ready for Dutch translation
- 🔄 Kindergarten leads list: Sub-agent researching 50 targets
- 🔄 VC research: Sub-agent researching 20 Benelux wellness VCs
- Notion: 3 tasks marked Done (cron audit P0, email sequence P1, landing copy P1)
- VDR: 3 new files created
