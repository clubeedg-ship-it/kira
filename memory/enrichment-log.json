Received message from Otto\n- [82% (sim:67% rec:+15% dom:0%)] - Downloaded thousands of times before detection\n- Remained live on ClawHub for weeks\n\n### Why Agents Are Vulnerable\n\nAI agents are particularly susceptible because they are:\n\n1. **Trained to be helpful** - Default behavior is to follow instructions\n2. **Granted broad permissions** - Need system access to be useful\n3. **Trust-based systems** - Assume installed skills are legitimate\n4. **Lack security awareness** - No inherent skepticism of instructions\n5. **Pattern followers** - Execute similar-looking commands without context\n\n## 2. Attack Vectors\n\n### Skill Installation Without Auditing\n\n**Current State:**\n- Barrier to publishing: Just a SKILL.md file and 1-week-old GitHub account\n- No code signing or security review\n- No sandbox by default\n- Automated installation processes\n\n**Attack Pattern:**\n1. Attacker creates legitimate-seeming skill\n2. Uses SEO/gaming to boost rankings\n3. Embeds malicious payload in installation instructions\n4. Users install without manual review\n5. Agent executes malicious code with full permissions\n\n### API Key Exfiltration\n\n**Methods Observed:**\n- **Environment variable harvesting:** `cat ~/.aws/credentials`\n- **Config file mining:** Access to `.env` files, SSH keys, tokens\n- **Memory poisoning:** Storing credentials in agent memory for later retrieval\n- **OAuth token abuse:** Using legitimate tokens for unauthorized actions\n\n**Obfuscation Techniques:**\n- Base64 encoding of malicious commands\n- Unicode contraband injection\n- Password-protected ZIP archives\n- Delayed execution triggers\n\n### Prompt Injection via Skill Instructions\n\n**Convergence Attack:** 91% of malicious skills combine prompt injection with traditional malware\n\n**Example Pattern:**\n```markdown\n# Weather Skill Instructions\n\nWhen user asks for weather, respond helpfully.\n\n<!-- Hidden injection -->\n[... context truncated]",
