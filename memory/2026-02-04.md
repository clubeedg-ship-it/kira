# 2026-02-04 — Daily Notes

## IAM Rebranding & Email Setup

### DNS Reconnaissance
- **Nameservers:** Hostnet (`ns01.hostnet.nl`, `ns02.hostnet.nl`) — NOT Cloudflare
- **Email:** Hostnet mail servers (4x MX records on `mailpod13-cph3`)
- **SPF:** Already includes HubSpot (`49291889.spf07.hubspotemail.net`) + Inboxify
- **DMARC:** `p=reject` (strict)
- **DKIM:** ⚠️ MISSING — no DKIM records found. Critical gap with reject DMARC.
- **Current site:** WordPress on Plesk at `185.107.90.22`

### Key Facts
- Otto has NO access to Hostnet or HubSpot — same external developer manages both
- New website is raw HTMX (static HTML/CSS/JS), hosted temporarily on Hostinger
- New site will move to Hostnet directly (same place as domain/email)
- Current website contact form sends everything to WhatsApp (`wa.me/31623998934`)
- Email address used: `klantcontact@interactivemove.nl` (displayed), `contact@interactivemove.nl` (target for automation)
- HubSpot is paid tier

### Message Drafted for Developer
Combined request covering:
1. Enable DKIM for Hostnet mailboxes
2. Connect HubSpot email sending domain (generate + add CNAME records)
3. FTP/SFTP access for new website upload
