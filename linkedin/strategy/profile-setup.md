## About Section
```
I build companies that make people move, learn, and grow.

At 18, I moved to the Netherlands alone with nothing. Now I lead three companies at the intersection of technology and human potential:

🎯 InterActiveMove — Interactive projection systems used by 500+ schools, rehab centers, and entertainment venues across the Netherlands. We turn any floor, wall, or surface into an interactive experience that gets people moving and learning.

💡 ZenithCred — Corporate wellness reimagined. We're combining light panels, biofeedback, and gamification to transform how companies approach employee health. Because sitting at a desk 8 hours a day is killing productivity and people.

⚡ OttoGen — AI consulting for SMBs. Helping businesses automate what should be automated, so humans can focus on what matters.

What drives me: technology should serve people, not the other way around. Every product I build starts with a simple question — does this make someone's life measurably better?

Let's connect if you're in:
→ Education technology
→ Corporate wellness / HR tech
→ Interactive entertainment
→ AI implementation

Always open to conversations about the future of human-technology interaction.
