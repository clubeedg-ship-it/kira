# Chimera — Deep Strategy
*Kira | Feb 8, 2026*

## The $500M+ Bet

Chimera is the only asset in the portfolio with a plausible path to massive valuation. It sits at the intersection of three mega-trends: AI infrastructure, privacy/sovereignty, and decentralized compute.

---

## Current State
- Architecture: Consultant → Job Queue → Savants (blind compute)
- Build: Phase 1+2 complete, 162 tests passing
- Components: Memory Graph, Consultant, Voice, Queue, Savant Manager
- Team: Otto + Kira (AI)
- Revenue: €0
- Community: None (repo is private)

## Timeline to Something Demonstrable

### Month 1-2 (Feb-Mar 2026): Open Source Launch
- [ ] Public GitHub repo with clean README, architecture docs
- [ ] Technical whitepaper (10-15 pages): problem, approach, architecture, comparison to Nillion/Golem/Akash
- [ ] Discord server for developer community
- [ ] First blog post: "Why We're Building Chimera"
- [ ] Demo video: show a simple blind compute task running across nodes

### Month 3-4 (Apr-May): Developer Preview
- [ ] Anyone can spin up a Savant node (Docker container)
- [ ] Basic Job Ticket system working end-to-end
- [ ] Documentation for developers to build on Chimera
- [ ] Hackathon or bounty program (even small — €500-1K prizes)
- [ ] 5-10 external contributors making PRs

### Month 5-6 (Jun-Jul): Testnet
- [ ] Public testnet with real distributed nodes
- [ ] 50+ node operators
- [ ] Basic tokenomics design (compute credits)
- [ ] Security audit (basic — can come from community)
- [ ] Partnership/integration with 1-2 AI projects

### Month 7-8 (Aug-Oct): Fundraise
- [ ] Seed/pre-seed round ($1-5M at $15-30M valuation)
- [ ] Pitch: working testnet + community + privacy narrative
- [ ] Target investors: Paradigm, Polychain, Multicoin, Hack VC (Nillion backers)
- [ ] Token presale structure if applicable

## What Would Make VCs Throw Money

### The Pitch That Works
1. **Narrative:** "The only infrastructure where AI can't be shut down, surveilled, or censored. Every authoritarian government proves why this matters."
2. **Timing:** Post-OpenAI-drama, governments regulating AI, China building surveillance AI. Privacy compute is THE narrative.
3. **Technical moat:** ZK Membrane + blind Savant architecture. Not just another Golem/Akash.
4. **Community:** If 500+ developers are building on it, VCs will come to you.
5. **Token potential:** Compute token with real utility (pay for compute, earn for providing nodes) = massive crypto VC interest.

### What VCs Actually Check
1. **Is the tech real?** → Need working demo, not just tests
2. **Is there a team?** → Otto alone is a red flag. Need at least 1-2 hires.
3. **Is there community/traction?** → GitHub stars, Discord members, node operators
4. **Is the market big enough?** → AI compute market = $100B+. Privacy compute = emerging but massive.
5. **Can the token be liquid?** → Crypto VCs want exit via token, not IPO

## Open Source Strategy

### Why Open Source Is Non-Negotiable
1. Trust: "Privacy compute" that's closed source is an oxymoron
2. Community: Developers build on open platforms
3. Talent: Best engineers want to work on open source
4. Competitive moat: If 1000 developers depend on Chimera, it can't be killed
5. Valuation: Open source + token = 10-50x valuation of closed source equivalent

### License
- Recommend: **AGPL-3.0** or custom license (like Elastic/SSPL for commercial protection)
- Core protocol: fully open
- Enterprise features (managed hosting, SLA, priority support): proprietary
- This is the "open core" model used by every successful open source startup

### Community Building Plan
1. **Week 1:** Launch GitHub, Discord, X/Twitter account
2. **Month 1:** 50 GitHub stars, 100 Discord members
3. **Month 3:** 500 stars, 500 Discord, 10 contributors
4. **Month 6:** 2000+ stars, 1000+ Discord, 50+ contributors, 50+ node operators
5. **Month 8:** 5000+ stars = VC interest guaranteed

**Tactics:**
- Weekly dev updates on blog/Discord
- Bounty program for contributions
- Respond to every issue within 24 hours
- Partner with AI safety researchers (academic angle)
- Present at ETHGlobal, AI conferences

## Comparable Valuations

| Company | What | Funding | Valuation | Stage |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Nillion | Blind compute | $25M | $400M-750M FDV | Token launch |
| Golem | Decentralized compute | ~$9M | $200-400M FDV | Mature |
| Akash | Decentralized cloud | $2M+ | $500M+ FDV | Production |
| Render | GPU compute | $30M | $3B+ FDV | Production |
| Ritual | AI + Crypto infra | $25M Series A | ~$200M+ | Early |

**Chimera's edge over these:** Privacy-first architecture (ZK Membrane), designed for AI workloads specifically, not just generic compute.

## Honest Assessment

Chimera is the real deal conceptually. The architecture is novel. The timing is right. But:

1. **It's pre-everything:** No public code, no community, no funding
2. **One person can't build decentralized infrastructure:** Need at least 3-5 engineers
3. **8 months to $500M is fantasy:** 8 months to $15-30M seed is ambitious but possible
4. **The path is clear but long:** Open source → community → testnet → fund → build → Series A → production → Series B → $1B

**Realistic $1B timeline for Chimera: 2028-2029.** But the work starts NOW.

## Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. Clean up repo for public launch
2. Write README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
3. Draft whitepaper outline
4. Set up chimera-protocol Discord server
5. Create X/Twitter account for Chimera
6. Write first blog post: "Introducing Chimera"
