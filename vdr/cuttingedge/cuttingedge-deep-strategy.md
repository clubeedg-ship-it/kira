# CuttingEdge — Deep Strategy

## What Is CuttingEdge?
Interior design & rebuilding project management. Unclear if it's a tool (SaaS) or a service.

## Revenue Model Clarity Needed

**Option A: Service business** — Otto/team manages interior design projects for clients. Revenue = per-project fees. Low scalability, competes with established firms.

**Option B: SaaS tool** — Software for interior designers to manage their projects. Revenue = subscriptions. Scalable but crowded market (Houzz Pro, Ivy, DesignFiles, Monday.com).

**Recommendation:** Otto needs to decide. If it's a service, it's CuttingEdge = side income. If it's a SaaS, it needs dedicated development.

## Portfolio Priority: LOW

**Honest assessment:**
- There's no clear competitive advantage
- Market isn't aligned with Oopuo's AI/tech narrative
- Every hour spent here is an hour NOT spent on OttoGen, IAM, ZenithCred, or Chimera
- If it's currently generating revenue from active projects, maintain it at minimum effort
- If it's not generating revenue, **park it**

## Recommendation
**STATUS: MAINTENANCE ONLY.** Complete any active projects. Don't pursue new business. Revisit post-funding when there's bandwidth and team.
