# CuttingEdge UX Strategy Document

**Website:** www.cuttingedge.world  
**Prepared:** February 2026  
**Objective:** Transform a generic-feeling site into a high-converting, premium interior design brand

---

## Executive Summary

### What's Wrong Now

The current site suffers from **corporate vacancy syndrome**. Phrases like "Translating vision into enduring reality" and "Crafted Experiences" say nothing. They could belong to any design firm, any architect, any agency.

**Specific problems identified:**

1. **Zero proof** — No visible projects, before/afters, or case studies with detail
2. **Generic copy** — "Pragmatic Luxury" is abstract; what does it *mean* for the client?
3. **No personality** — Who runs this? Why do they care? What's their taste?
4. **Weak structure** — Projects page exists but shows almost nothing; About page 404s
5. **No client story** — No testimonials, no "we transformed X for Y" narratives
6. **Corporate buzzwords** — "brand-driven design approaches," "scalable and reproducible," "fast and lean solutions" — this is consultant-speak, not human language

**The fix:** Replace abstraction with specificity. Show, don't tell. Make every element earn its place by proving something real.

---

### Voice & Tone Guidelines

**Voice:** Confident but not arrogant. Expert but not lecturing. Personal but not casual.

**Tone principles:**
1. **Direct over decorative** — "We handle contractors" not "We facilitate comprehensive vendor relationships"
2. **Specific over vague** — "6 restaurants in 18 months" not "extensive F&B experience"
3. **Show over tell** — A photo of a completed project beats any description
4. **Human over corporate** — "I" and "we" are people, not entities
5. **Confident over humble** — Don't apologize for being good

**Example rewrites:**

*Before:* "With expertise across hospitality, residential, and commercial sectors, CuttingEdge creates spaces that inspire, innovate, and elevate experiences worldwide."

*After:* "We design interiors for luxury homes, restaurants, and hotels. We manage everything from first sketch to final installation. Here's what that looks like."

## 3. Page Flow Recommendations

### Homepage Structure

**Hero Section (0-3 seconds)**
- Full-bleed photo of best single project (not a collage)
- One clear headline: "Turn-Key Interior Design" or "Design. Build. Done."
- One supporting line that addresses the main objection: "We handle everything — so you don't have to"
- One CTA: "See Our Work" (not "Learn More")

**Proof Section (3-10 seconds)**
- 3 project thumbnails with hover-reveal stats:
  - Project type + location + timeline
  - "Private Home, Amsterdam — 4 months"
  - "Restaurant Chain, 6 Locations — 18 months"
- Each thumbnail links to full case study
- No text explanations needed if photos are strong

**Process Section (10-20 seconds)**
- 3 steps, visually illustrated:
  1. **Design** — "We translate your vision into detailed plans"
  2. **Coordinate** — "We manage contractors, suppliers, timelines"
  3. **Deliver** — "We hand you the keys to a finished space"
- Optional: vertical timeline animation on scroll

**Sectors Section (20-30 seconds)**
- Three clear categories with one hero image each:
  - **Residential** — Photo of living room
  - **Hospitality** — Photo of hotel lobby or restaurant
  - **Commercial** — Photo of branded retail or office
- Each links to filtered portfolio

**Social Proof Section (30-45 seconds)**
- 2-3 testimonials with:
  - Client name (even first name only)
  - Project type
  - One specific quote ("They managed 12 contractors and we never had to call one")
- If no testimonials yet: press mentions or partner logos

**CTA Section (45+ seconds)**
- Simple: "Have a project in mind?"
- Contact form or "Schedule a Call" button
- Minimal fields: Name, Email, Project Type (dropdown), Brief Description

---

### Portfolio/Case Study Structure

**Portfolio Index Page:**
- Grid of projects with smart filtering:
  - By type: Residential / Hospitality / Commercial
  - By scale: Under €100K / €100K-€500K / €500K+
- Each thumbnail shows: One hero photo, project type, location (not full address)
- Hover reveals: "View Project →"

**Individual Case Study Page:**

1. **Hero** — Full-bleed best photo
2. **Quick Facts** (right sidebar or top strip):
   - Project type
   - Location
   - Timeline
   - Scope (design only / full turn-key)
   - Square meters
3. **The Brief** — 2-3 sentences max on what client wanted
4. **The Challenge** — What made this project interesting/difficult
5. **The Solution** — Your approach (but brief — let photos do the work)
6. **Photo Gallery** — 8-15 photos, well-captioned
   - Include detail shots, not just wide angles
   - Show materials, fixtures, custom elements
7. **Before/After** — If available, this is GOLD. Use slider or side-by-side.
8. **Technical Drawings** — Optional section showing floor plans, electrical, etc. (proves rigor)
9. **Client Quote** — If available, one testimonial from this specific project
10. **Related Projects** — 2-3 similar projects to continue browsing

---

### About Page Strategy

**Current state:** 404 error. This is a major problem.

**What the About page must do:**
- Humanize the brand (who is behind this?)
- Establish credentials (why should I trust you?)
- Differentiate (why you vs. the 50 other firms?)

**Recommended structure:**

1. **Founder/Team Photo** — Real humans, not stock. In a project space ideally.
2. **Origin Story** — 2-3 paragraphs max. Why did you start this? What's your background? What do you believe about design?
3. **Philosophy** — What makes your approach different? (But make it specific, not "we care about quality")
4. **Credentials** — Education, certifications, notable past projects, press mentions
5. **Team** — If there's a team, brief bios with photos
6. **Fun Fact / Personal Touch** — Something memorable and human

**Example copy approach:**

> "CuttingEdge was founded in [year] by [name], after [X years] working at [notable firm/context]. 
>
> I started this firm because I was frustrated by [specific problem] — designers who hand over drawings and disappear, leaving clients to manage chaos.
>
> We do it differently. Every project, we stay until the last chair is placed. We manage the contractors so you don't have to translate. We handle the stress so you can just anticipate the result.
>
> Based in [city], we work across the Netherlands and beyond."

### Contact/Inquiry Flow

**Current state:** Contact page shows almost nothing.

**Recommended structure:**

1. **Headline:** "Let's Talk About Your Project"
2. **Brief reassurance:** "No commitment. Just a conversation to see if we're a fit."
3. **Form fields:**
   - Name (required)
   - Email (required)
   - Phone (optional)
   - Project Type: Dropdown — Residential / Restaurant / Hotel / Other
   - Project Location (city/region)
   - Estimated Budget: Dropdown — Under €50K / €50K-€150K / €150K-€500K / €500K+
   - Brief Description (text area)
   - How did you find us? (optional dropdown)
4. **Alternative contact:** Direct email and phone for those who prefer
5. **Response expectation:** "We respond within 48 hours"

**Post-submission:**
- Confirmation page with: "Thanks [Name]. We'll be in touch within 48 hours."
- Immediate auto-email with: confirmation + what to expect next

---

## 4. Visual Strategy

### Visual Gimmicks That Work

**1. Before/After Sliders**
- THE most effective visual for interior design
- Use on homepage hero (one strong example)
- Use in every case study where photos exist
- Implementation: Simple drag slider, works on mobile

**2. Process Animation (Scroll-Triggered)**
- As user scrolls, show design → drawings → construction → finished
- Can use actual project photos
- Illustrates turn-key value proposition

**3. Hover-Reveal Stats**
- Portfolio thumbnails show photo only
- Hover reveals: project name, type, timeline
- Maintains clean grid while providing info

**4. Photo Zoom/Gallery**
- Click any project photo to open full-screen gallery
- Allow swipe navigation
- Include captions (material, custom detail, etc.)

**5. Video Walkthroughs (If Available)**
- 30-60 second walkthrough of completed space
- No narration needed — just music and movement
- Embed in case studies

**6. Material/Detail Closeups**
- Small grid of macro shots: fabric texture, brass hardware, marble veining
- Proves attention to detail without words

**What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Parallax everything (dated)
- ❌ Auto-playing hero videos (annoying)
- ❌ Excessive animations that slow load time
- ❌ Stock photos (death of credibility)
- ❌ 3D renders without noting they're renders

---

### Photo Style Guidelines

**Required shots for every project:**
1. Wide establishing shot (the "hero")
2. Medium shots of each room/zone
3. Detail shots (3-5 per project): fixtures, materials, custom elements
4. Human-scale reference (optional): person in space or furniture showing scale
5. Technical elements (for B2B): drawings, specs, construction process

**Photo quality standards:**
- Professional photography only (no iPhone snaps)
- Consistent editing style across portfolio
- Natural light preferred, well-lit interiors essential
- Stage spaces properly (no construction debris, no personal clutter)
- Wide-angle but not distorted (no fisheye effect)

**Caption style:**
- Material + source when notable: "Italian Calacatta marble countertops"
- Custom elements flagged: "Custom brass pendant by [maker]"
- Room function: "Primary bedroom looking toward ensuite"

---

### How to Show "Premium" Without Saying It

**Visual cues that signal quality:**
- High-resolution photography (this is non-negotiable)
- Generous white space in layout
- Restrained color palette on website (let projects be colorful)
- Typography: clean, editorial, not "corporate"
- Grid alignment that's precise but not rigid
- Paper/material texture in backgrounds (subtle)

**Content cues that signal quality:**
- Specificity in language (materials named, locations named)
- Client-level confidentiality respected (first names, not full names)
- Process details that show rigor
- Before/after that shows transformation
- Press mentions or awards if available

**What undermines premium positioning:**
- ❌ Too many words explaining what's self-evident in photos
- ❌ Generic stock imagery anywhere
- ❌ Pop-ups, aggressive CTAs, discount language
- ❌ Busy layouts with competing elements
- ❌ Low-resolution images or blurry photos
- ❌ Inconsistent photo editing style

## 5. Conversion Optimization

### CTA Placement Strategy

| Page | Primary CTA | Placement |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Homepage | "See Our Work" | Hero, bottom of page |
| Portfolio | "Discuss Your Project" | Sticky footer or after 3+ project views |
| Case Study | "Have a Similar Project?" | End of case study |
| About | "Work With Us" | End of page |
| Contact | "Send Message" | Within form |

**CTA principles:**
- Never more than 2 CTA types per page
- Primary CTA button: high contrast, clear verb
- Secondary links: text-link style, lower hierarchy
- Don't ask for commitment too early (let them browse first)
- Mobile: sticky CTA at bottom on long scroll pages

---

### Social Proof Elements Needed

**Priority 1 (Get these first):**
- 3-5 client testimonials with:
  - Name (first name + last initial minimum)
  - Project type
  - Specific quote about experience or result
- Before/after photos for 3+ projects

**Priority 2:**
- Named project examples ("The Hoxton Hotel Amsterdam" vs. "a hotel in Amsterdam")
- Google Reviews / Houzz Reviews embedded or linked
- Partner/supplier logos (if working with notable brands)

**Priority 3:**
- Press mentions (design blogs, magazines)
- Awards or certifications
- Social media embed showing completed work + engagement

**How to get testimonials if you don't have them:**
- Email past clients directly: "Would you mind sharing a few words about your experience?"
- Offer to write draft they can edit
- LinkedIn recommendations work too (screenshot or link)
- Even informal texts/emails can be quoted with permission

---
