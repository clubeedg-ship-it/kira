*Kira | Feb 8, 2026 | Based on Reality Check Math*
*Critic-reviewed 2026-02-08*

---

## North Star (Revised)
**By October 2026:** €30-60M portfolio valuation (stretch target), with Chimera positioned for Series A. Monthly revenue covering Otto's living costs. ZenithCred seed closed.

---

## Month-by-Month

### FEBRUARY 2026 — "First Revenue"
**What must be true by Feb 28:**
- OttoGen has landed 3-5 paying clients (€2K-5K total)
- IAM has 2-3 warm leads in kindergarten pipeline
- ZenithCred pitch deck is investor-ready
- Chimera open-source repo is public with README

**Critical path:** Otto's first paid AI services gig. Everything else is noise until rent is covered.

**Resource allocation:**
- Otto: 60% OttoGen sales, 20% IAM sales, 20% ZenithCred prep
- Kira: Lead gen automation, pitch deck refinement, Chimera docs

**Key milestones:**
- [ ] 20 SMBs contacted (OttoGen) — **Target list needed: define verticals (e.g., NL-based agencies, e-commerce, logistics SMBs with 5-50 employees), source from KvK/LinkedIn Sales Navigator, prioritize by AI-readiness signals (job posts mentioning automation, active on LinkedIn)**
- [ ] First €500+ invoice sent
- [ ] IAM prospect list contacted (top 10)
- [ ] ZenithCred pitch deck v3 complete
- [ ] Chimera GitHub repo live (public)

---

### MARCH 2026 — "Pipeline Building"
**What must be true by Mar 31:**
- OttoGen: 5-8 clients, €3-7K monthly run rate *(revised down — industry data shows $8-15K/month typically takes 12-24 months for AI consulting; 5-8 clients in month 2 is already aggressive)*
- IAM: 1-2 pilot installations (free/discounted for case study)
- ZenithCred: First 3-5 investor meetings scheduled
- Chimera: Technical whitepaper published

**Critical path:** OttoGen revenue scaling. Need enough cash flow that Otto isn't stressed about rent.

**Resource allocation:**
- Otto: 50% OttoGen delivery, 20% IAM pilots, 20% ZenithCred meetings, 10% Chimera
- Kira: Client automation, investor outreach sequences, whitepaper drafting

**Key milestones:**
- [ ] OttoGen monthly revenue > €3K (stretch: €5K)
- [ ] IAM pilot installed and filming testimonial
- [ ] ZenithCred investor pipeline of 20+ prospects
- [ ] Chimera whitepaper published online

---

### APRIL 2026 — "Validation"
**What must be true by Apr 30:**
- OttoGen: €5-8K/month, systematizing delivery *(revised — €8-12K by month 3 requires exceptional close rate; first hire is premature without €10K+ stable MRR)*
- IAM: 1-3 paying lease customers *(revised — going from free pilots in March to 3-5 paying in April assumes instant conversion; 1-3 is more realistic)*
- ZenithCred: 5+ investor meetings completed, warm interest from 1-2 *(revised — term sheet by April requires product progress or exceptional team narrative; LOI/term sheet more realistic for May-June)*
- Chimera: Developer community forming (Discord 50-100 members)

**Critical path:** Building ZenithCred investor conviction. Term sheet likely slips to May-June without demo/MVP progress.

**Resource allocation:**
- Otto: 40% OttoGen, 20% IAM, 30% ZenithCred (investor meetings), 10% Chimera
- Kira: Everything operational + investor follow-up automation

**Key milestones:**
- [ ] IAM ARR hits €10K+
- [ ] ZenithCred has 5+ investor meetings completed, 1-2 warm leads
- [ ] Chimera Discord launched, 50+ devs
- [ ] OttoGen: identify first contractor candidate (hire when MRR > €8K stable)

---

### MAY 2026 — "Seed Round"
**What must be true by May 31:**
- ZenithCred seed: term sheet signed or near-closing (€1.1M at €2.5-3.5M pre-money) *(moved from April — more realistic timeline)*
- OttoGen: €8-12K/month, 1 contractor onboarding
- IAM: 8-10 paying units, expanding to BSO market
- Chimera: Testnet alpha running

**Critical path:** Seed close. Money in the bank.

**Resource allocation:**
- Otto: 30% OttoGen (delegating), 20% IAM, 20% ZenithCred close, 30% Chimera
- Kira: Seed round logistics, Chimera development support
- New: ZenithCred hire (product/engineering)

**Key milestones:**
- [ ] €1.1M in bank
- [ ] First ZenithCred hire onboarded
- [ ] Chimera testnet live (internal)
- [ ] IAM ARR €15-25K

---

### JUNE 2026 — "Building Mode"
**What must be true by Jun 30:**
- ZenithCred MVP being built with seed money
- Chimera: Open testnet, first external node operators
- IAM: 12-15 units, €36-54K ARR
- OttoGen: €15K/month, mostly delegated

**Critical path:** Chimera testnet launch. This is what creates the narrative for a bigger round.

**Resource allocation:**
- Otto: 40% Chimera, 20% ZenithCred oversight, 20% IAM growth, 20% OttoGen oversight
- Kira: Chimera community management, ZenithCred product ops
- Team: 2-3 people (ZenithCred dev, OttoGen contractor, Chimera contributor)

---

### JULY 2026 — "Traction"
**What must be true by Jul 31:**
- Chimera: 50+ external nodes, growing daily
- ZenithCred: MVP in pilot with 2-3 companies
- IAM: 20+ units, exploring Belgium/Germany
- Portfolio total ARR: €100K+

**Critical path:** Chimera community growth. Need organic developer interest.

**Key milestones:**
- [ ] Chimera: 50 nodes, 500 Discord members
- [ ] ZenithCred: 2 paying pilots
- [ ] IAM: Belgium expansion started
- [ ] Total monthly revenue: €15K+

---

### AUGUST 2026 — "Fundraise Prep"
**What must be true by Aug 31:**
- Chimera: Pre-seed/Seed round prep (targeting €2-5M at €15-30M valuation)
- ZenithCred: 5 paying customers, product-market fit signals
- IAM: 25-30 units
- Begin conversations with tier-1 VCs for Chimera

**Critical path:** Chimera fundraise narrative. Need compelling deck + demo + community metrics.

**Resource allocation:**
- Otto: 50% Chimera fundraise, 30% portfolio oversight, 20% vision/content
- Kira: Pitch deck, investor research, data room prep

---

### SEPTEMBER 2026 — "Chimera Round"
**What must be true by Sep 30:**
- Chimera seed/pre-seed term sheet
- ZenithCred: €300K+ ARR trajectory
- Portfolio total: €200K+ ARR
- Team: 5-8 people across portfolio

**Critical path:** Chimera funding closes or is near-closing.

---

### OCTOBER 2026 — "Checkpoint"
**Realistic outcome:**
- Portfolio valuation: €30-60M (stretch)
- Chimera: Funded at €15-30M, growing community
- ZenithCred: Post-seed, €3.5-5M valuation, revenue generating
- IAM: €75-100K ARR, profitable unit economics
- OttoGen: €180K+ annualized, 2-3 contractors
- Team: 8-12 people total
- Cash position: €1-2M+ (from ZenithCred seed + Chimera seed)

## 5 Highest-Leverage Moves

### 1. OttoGen First 5 Clients (February)
**Why:** Cash flow eliminates desperation. A desperate founder makes bad decisions. €5K/month changes everything psychologically and practically.

### 2. ZenithCred Seed Close (April-May)
**Why:** €1.1M unlocks hiring, which unlocks product development, which unlocks everything. Without this money, the portfolio is one-person-with-AI forever.

### 3. Chimera Open Source Launch (February-March)
**Why:** Community is the new moat. Open source creates narrative, attracts talent, builds credibility. Every day the repo is private is a wasted day.

### 4. First IAM Kindergarten Pilot (March)
**Why:** Video testimonial of kids using the product = marketing gold. One pilot with filmed results converts 10 more sales. Proof > promises.

### 5. Chimera Seed Round (August-September)
**Why:** This is the portfolio's only shot at a big valuation. €2-5M at €15-30M sets the stage for Series A in 2027 at €100-300M, which is the actual $1B path.

## Resource Constraints (Real Talk)

**Money:** Near zero. OttoGen must generate cash immediately.
**People:** Just Otto + Kira. Must leverage AI automation maximally until funding.
**Time:** Otto is one human. He can do ~50 productive hours/week max. Spreading across 7 companies = 7 hours each = nothing gets done.

**Hour reality check:** At 50h/week with 3 active companies, that's ~17h each. OttoGen sales + delivery alone could consume 30h/week. Otto must ruthlessly delegate to Kira anything that doesn't require a human face (proposals, follow-ups, scheduling, invoicing, CRM updates).

**The answer:** Focus. Maximum 3 active companies at any time.
- **Feb-Apr:** OttoGen (cash), IAM (revenue), ZenithCred (funding)
- **May-Jul:** ZenithCred (build), Chimera (launch), IAM (grow)
- **Aug-Oct:** Chimera (fundraise), ZenithCred (scale), IAM (auto-pilot)

SentinAgro, CuttingEdge, Kira Ops → PARKED until post-funding.
