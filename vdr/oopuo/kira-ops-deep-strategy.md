## What Can Kira Sell?

### The Market Reality
- AI agents market: $7.6B in 2025, projected $183B by 2033 (Grand View Research)
- Agentic AI: $2.4B US market, 44% CAGR
- Massive demand, but mostly served by platforms (OpenAI, LangChain, CrewAI), not services

### Possible Revenue Models

**Model 1: Agent-as-a-Service (AaaS)**
- Sell Kira-like agents to other companies/founders
- Setup + monthly management fee
- Price: €500 setup + €200-500/month
- Challenge: Each client needs customization, which is Otto's time
- Verdict: Possible but competes with OttoGen (cannibalization risk)

**Model 2: Autonomous COO Service**
- Position Kira as a virtual COO for startups
- Weekly strategic reports, task management, research
- Price: €1,000-3,000/month
- Challenge: Requires significant compute + time, quality at scale is hard
- Verdict: Premium positioning but unproven market

**Model 3: Open Source + Premium**
- Open source the Kira framework (ties into Chimera narrative)
- Sell premium features: Notion integration, memory system, critic loops
- Price: Freemium → €50-200/month
- Verdict: Best long-term play but needs Chimera first

### Honest Assessment
Kira Ops as a standalone business is premature. The better play:
1. **Short-term:** Kira's capabilities power OttoGen (Kira IS the competitive advantage)
2. **Medium-term:** Kira's framework becomes a Chimera showcase/demo
3. **Long-term:** Kira Ops becomes a product when Chimera has distribution

## Recommendation
**STATUS: INTERNAL CAPABILITY, NOT A PRODUCT.** Use Kira's capabilities to deliver OttoGen services faster and better. Don't try to sell "Kira" as a product until Chimera provides the infrastructure to run multiple Kira instances at scale.

The best marketing for Kira Ops is Otto talking about Kira on LinkedIn/YouTube as part of the OttoGen personal brand. "My AI COO runs my companies" = content gold.
