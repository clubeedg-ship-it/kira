## 1. Executive Summary

ZenithCred offers a next-generation corporate wellness platform that combines **interactive light panels**, **real-time biofeedback**, and **gamification tokens** to drive measurable improvements in employee engagement, stress reduction, and physical activity.

Born from Interactive Move's hardware — proven across hundreds of kindergarten installations — ZenithCred brings the same intuitive, movement-driven technology into the corporate environment. The result: wellness that employees actually use.

We invite your organization to participate in a **fully complimentary 3-month pilot program** — no financial commitment, no long-term obligation. At the end of the pilot, you receive a comprehensive data-driven report on engagement, participation, and wellness outcomes. You decide what happens next.

## 2. The Problem

The modern workplace is facing a wellness crisis:

- **76% of employees** report experiencing burnout at least sometimes (Gallup, 2024).
- **$322 billion** in global turnover and lost productivity is attributed to employee burnout annually (WHO / Gallup).
- Sedentary work contributes to a **17% increase** in all-cause mortality risk (The Lancet, 2023).
- Only **24% of employees** actively engage with traditional corporate wellness programs such as gym memberships or EAP services (SHRM, 2024).

The core issue is not a lack of wellness offerings — it's a lack of **engagement**. Conventional programs (gym subsidies, meditation apps, lunch-and-learns) suffer from low adoption and steep drop-off. HR and People teams invest budget but struggle to demonstrate ROI.

**What's missing:** a wellness experience that is intuitive, social, measurable, and — critically — enjoyable enough that employees return to it day after day.

## 3. The ZenithCred Solution

ZenithCred is a **physical-digital wellness platform** designed for the workplace:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Interactive Light Panels** | Wall- or floor-mounted LED panels that respond to movement, creating guided physical challenges, reaction games, and group activities. Hardware proven across 500+ installations in education. |
| **Biofeedback Integration** | Optional wearable sync (heart rate, stress indicators) that personalizes session intensity and tracks physiological outcomes over time. |
| **Gamification Engine** | Employees earn ZenithCred tokens for participation — redeemable for rewards, leaderboard placement, or team challenges. Drives sustained engagement through intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. |
| **Analytics Dashboard** | Real-time reporting for HR/wellness leads: participation rates, session frequency, biofeedback trends, and department-level engagement metrics. |

### Why It Works

- **Low barrier to entry** — no athletic ability required; sessions start at 2 minutes.
- **Social by design** — team challenges and leaderboards create organic community.
- **Data-driven** — every interaction is measured, giving People teams the evidence they need.
- **Novel and engaging** — the light-panel experience is unlike anything employees have encountered in a wellness context, driving curiosity and repeat usage.
