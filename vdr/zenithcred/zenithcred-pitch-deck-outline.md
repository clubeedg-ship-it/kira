## 1. Problem (What Pain Point)

### The Corporate Wellness Crisis
- **Employee engagement at historic lows**: Only 21% of global employees are engaged (Gallup 2024)
- **Mental health costs soaring**: 12 billion working days lost annually to depression/anxiety = $1T in lost productivity (WHO)
- **Existing solutions fail to sustain engagement**: Wellness apps see declining usage after first month
- **Physical workspace disconnect**: Hybrid/remote work means office needs compelling wellness experience

### The Three-Layer Problem
1. **HR Directors**: Spend on wellness programs but struggle to prove ROI or sustained engagement
2. **Employees**: Want wellness support but don't engage with screen-based apps long-term
3. **Facilities**: Office spaces don't actively participate in employee wellbeing

### Market Validation
- Corporate wellness market growing 7.41% CAGR ($63.68B in 2024 → $129.44B by 2034)
- European wearables market growing fastest globally (25%+ CAGR)
- Netherlands: ~12,000 companies in target segment (100-500 employees)
