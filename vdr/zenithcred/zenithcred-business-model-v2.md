## 1. Market Sizing (Benelux-Specific)

### TAM/SAM/SOM Analysis

**Sources:** Eurostat business statistics, CBS Netherlands, FEDERGON Belgium, industry reports (Deloitte HR Trends 2024, Josh Bersin)

#### Total Addressable Market (TAM) — Benelux Corporate Wellness

| Country | Companies 100-2000 emp | Avg Employees | Potential Seats | @ €10/seat/mo | Annual TAM |
|---------|------------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| Netherlands | ~15,000 | 280 | 4.2M | €10 | €504M |
| Belgium | ~12,000 | 260 | 3.1M | €10 | €372M |
| Luxembourg | ~800 | 300 | 240K | €10 | €29M |
| **Benelux Total** | **~27,800** | | **7.5M** | | **€905M** |

**TAM: ~€900M annually** (corporate wellness software/services for 100-2000 employee segment in Benelux)

*Assumption: Only companies with physical office presence. Excludes fully remote.*

#### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) — Innovation-Forward Segments

Our product requires: physical office, wellness budget, tech-forward culture.

| Filter | % of TAM | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Physical office presence (hybrid OK) | 70% | Excludes fully remote |
| Has wellness budget | 40% | Growing but not universal |
| Tech/innovation-forward culture | 50% | Early adopters |
| **SAM** | **14%** | **€126M** |

**SAM: ~€125M annually** (Benelux companies likely to consider hardware-integrated wellness)

#### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) — 3-Year Realistic Share

| Year | Market Share | SOM |
|------|--------------|-----|
| Year 1 | 0.2% | €250K |
| Year 2 | 0.8% | €1.0M |
| Year 3 | 1.9% | €2.4M |

**Year 3 SOM: €2.4M ARR** (65 customers × €37K average)

*Assumption: First-mover advantage in hardware-wellness niche. No major competitor entry.*

## 3. Unit Economics (Corrected)

### Assumptions (Explicit & Conservative)

| Metric | Value | Rationale | Sensitivity |
|--------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Average company size | 180 employees | Mid-market, conservative | HIGH |
| Participation rate | 60% | Opt-in, realistic adoption | MEDIUM |
| Active users per customer | 108 employees | 180 × 60% | |
| Average contract value (ACV) | €25,920/year | 180 × €12 × 12 months | HIGH |
| Hardware revenue per deal | €5,500 | Average installation | LOW |
| Initial contract length | 12 months | Standard, annual renewal | |
| Gross margin (SaaS) | 78% | After CS allocation | MEDIUM |
| Gross margin (Hardware) | 25% | After installation, warranty, shipping | LOW |
| Blended gross margin | 68% | Weighted (80% SaaS, 20% HW) | |

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) — Realistic

**Methodology:** Enterprise B2B benchmarks for Benelux, not optimistic assumptions.

| Component | Cost | Calculation |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Sales salary (allocated) | €12,000 | AE @ €80K fully-loaded, 30% time/deal, 5-mo cycle |
| Marketing cost per deal | €4,000 | €400/lead × 10 leads (industry benchmark) |
| Sales tools/travel | €1,500 | CRM, demos, client visits |
| Proof-of-concept | €2,500 | Pilot equipment, installation, time |
| **Total CAC** | **€20,000** | |

**CAC by Channel:**

| Channel | CAC | % of Deals | Rationale |
|---------|-----|------------|-----------|
| Direct outbound | €24,000 | 40% | Full sales cycle, cold |
| Inbound marketing | €18,000 | 30% | Lower touch, warmer |
| Partner/referral | €16,000 | 30% | Referral fee 20% ACV + overhead |
| **Blended CAC** | **€20,000** | 100% | |

*Note: V1 used €11,500 which underestimated sales allocation and marketing costs by ~40%.*

### Churn — Conservative for Unproven Product

| Year | Logo Churn | Rationale |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Year 1 | 25% | New product, finding PMF, some mis-sold pilots |
| Year 2 | 20% | Improving product, better customer selection |
| Year 3 | 15% | Established product, mature CS |

*Assumption: Churn IMPROVES as we learn who our best customers are and product matures. Initial churn higher than V1 assumed.*

**Why not 15% from Day 1:**
- Hardware products have implementation risk
- Behavior change products have adoption risk
- New vendor = higher switching likelihood
- First-year products rarely hit mature churn rates

### Lifetime Value (LTV) — Conservative 3-Year Horizon

**Why 3-year, not 6.67-year:**
- Cannot credibly claim 7-year lifetime for product that doesn't exist
- Investors discount long-dated projections heavily
- 3-year horizon is standard conservative practice

**LTV Calculation (with annual churn applied):**

| Year | Retention | Revenue | Gross Profit |
|------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | 100% | €31,420 | €21,366 |
| 2 | 80% | €20,736 | €16,174 |
| 3 | 64% | €16,589 | €12,939 |
| **3-Year LTV** | | | **€50,479** |

*Year 1 includes hardware (€5,500 @ 25% = €1,375 GP) + SaaS (€25,920 @ 78% = €19,991 GP)*
*Year 2-3 SaaS only: €25,920 × retention × 78%*

**Conservative 3-Year LTV: €50,500**

### Key Ratios (Corrected)

| Metric | V1 Claimed | V2 Corrected | Target | Industry |
|--------|------------|--------------|--------|----------|
| **LTV:CAC** | 4.9x | **2.5x** | >3x | 3-5x healthy |
| **CAC Payback** | 7.5 mo | **14 mo** | <18 mo | 12-18 mo typical |
| **Gross Margin** | 72% | **68%** | >65% | 70-80% B2B SaaS |
| **Net Revenue Retention** | 105% | **95%** (Y1) | >100% | 100-120% |
| **Logo Churn** | 15% | **20%** (avg) | <20% | 15-25% SMB |

**Analysis:** LTV:CAC at 2.5x is below the ideal 3x threshold but acceptable for early-stage with clear path to improvement. CAC should decrease as brand awareness grows; churn should decrease as product matures.

## 4. Financial Projections (3 Years) — Corrected

### Revenue Forecast (Month-by-Month Accurate)

#### Year 1 Revenue — Corrected Calculation

**The Problem with V1:** Claimed €345K SaaS but the month-by-month ramp showed €162K. V1 used "12 customers × full year revenue" when customers were acquired throughout the year.

**Correct Approach:** Sum actual monthly billings.

| Month | New Customers | Total | MRR | Monthly Billing | Hardware |
|-------|---------------|-------|-----|-----------------|----------|
| 1 | 0 | 0 | €0 | €0 | €0 |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | €0 | €0 | €0 |
| 3 | 1 | 1 | €2,160 | €2,160 | €5,500 |
| 4 | 0 | 1 | €2,160 | €2,160 | €0 |
| 5 | 1 | 2 | €4,320 | €4,320 | €5,500 |
| 6 | 1 | 3 | €6,480 | €6,480 | €5,500 |
| 7 | 1 | 4 | €8,640 | €8,640 | €5,500 |
| 8 | 1 | 5 | €10,800 | €10,800 | €5,500 |
| 9 | 0 | 5 | €10,800 | €10,800 | €0 |
| 10 | 1 | 6 | €12,960 | €12,960 | €5,500 |
| 11 | 1 | 7 | €15,120 | €15,120 | €5,500 |
| 12 | 1 | 8 | €17,280 | €17,280 | €5,500 |
| **Year 1** | **8** | | | **€90,720** | **€44,000** |

**Year 1 Total Revenue: €135K** (not €418K as V1 claimed)
- SaaS: €90,720 (sum of monthly billings)
- Hardware: €44,000 (8 customers × €5,500)
- Ending MRR: €17,280 (ARR run-rate: €207K)

*Assumption: Sales begin Month 3 after MVP. Slower summer (Month 9). Realistic 8 customers, not 12.*

#### Year 2 Revenue — Realistic Ramp

| Metric | V1 Claimed | V2 Corrected | Rationale |
|--------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| Starting customers | 12 | 8 | Corrected Y1 |
| New customers | 42 | 22 | 3 AEs × 7-8 deals/year |
| Churned | 2 | 2 | 25% of Y1 cohort |
| Ending customers | 52 | 28 | |
| Avg customers | ~32 | ~18 | Linear ramp |

**Year 2 Revenue Calculation:**
- SaaS: 18 avg customers × €25,920 = €466,560
- Hardware: 22 new × €5,500 = €121,000
- **Year 2 Total: €588K** (not €1.75M as V1 claimed)
- Ending ARR: €725K (28 customers)

#### Year 3 Revenue — Benelux Expansion

| Metric | V2 Projection | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Starting customers | 28 | Y2 end |
| New customers | 45 | 5 AEs × 9 deals/year (improving) |
| Churned | 6 | 20% of Y1+Y2 cohorts |
| Ending customers | 67 | |
| Avg customers | ~48 | |

**Year 3 Revenue:**
- SaaS: 48 avg × €25,920 = €1,244,160
- Hardware: 45 new × €5,500 = €247,500
- Premium upsells: €100,000 (estimate)
- **Year 3 Total: €1.59M**
- Ending ARR: €1.74M (67 customers)

### Revenue Summary (Corrected Base Case)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Total Revenue** | €135K | €588K | €1,591K |
| SaaS Revenue | €91K | €467K | €1,244K |
| Hardware Revenue | €44K | €121K | €248K |
| Other/Upsells | €0 | €0 | €100K |
| Ending ARR | €207K | €725K | €1,736K |
| YoY Growth | — | 336% | 171% |
| Ending Customers | 8 | 28 | 67 |

**Comparison to V1:**

| Metric | V1 | V2 | Delta |
|--------|----|----|-------|
| Year 1 Revenue | €418K | €135K | **-68%** |
| Year 2 Revenue | €1.75M | €588K | **-66%** |
| Year 3 Revenue | €3.95M | €1.59M | **-60%** |

*V1 projections were systematically overstated due to mathematical errors and optimistic assumptions.*

## 6. Investment Ask — Corrected

### Seed Round: €1.1M

**Rationale:** V1 asked for €850K but:
- Revenue projections were 2x overstated
- CAC was underestimated by 40%
- This creates ~€250K additional capital need

| Use of Funds | Amount | % | Timeline |
|--------------|--------|---|----------|
| Product Development | €350,000 | 32% | M1-M18 |
| Sales & Marketing | €300,000 | 27% | M6-M24 |
| Operations & Team | €280,000 | 25% | M1-M24 |
| Hardware/Inventory | €80,000 | 7% | M1-M18 |
| Reserve/Buffer | €90,000 | 8% | — |
| **Total** | **€1,100,000** | **100%** | |

**Runway:** 24 months to monthly cash-flow positive

### Funding Timeline

| Milestone | Timing | Funding |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Pre-seed** | Now | €150K (founders + angels) |
| **Seed** | Month 3-6 | **€1.1M** (this raise) |
| **Bridge (if needed)** | Month 20-24 | €400K |
| **Series A** | Month 30-36 | €2-4M |

### Valuation Guidance

**Seed Round:**
- Pre-money: €2.0-3.0M
- Dilution: 25-35%
- Implied post-money: €3.1-4.1M

*Note: Lower valuation than V1 suggested due to corrected projections and earlier stage.*

### Series A Milestones

To raise Series A at Month 30-36:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| ARR | €1.0M+ |
| Customers | 35-40 |
