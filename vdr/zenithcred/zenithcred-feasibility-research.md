# ZenithCred Feasibility Research Report

**Interactive Move (IAM) - Corporate Wellness Gamification Platform**

**Date:** February 2026  
**Prepared for:** Strategic Decision Making

---

## Executive Summary

### Recommendation: **CONDITIONAL GO** ✅

ZenithCred represents a strong strategic opportunity with favorable market conditions, but requires careful positioning to succeed. The corporate wellness market is growing steadily ($63.68B in 2024 → $129.44B by 2034, 7.41% CAGR), and there's a clear gap for innovative, hardware-integrated wellness solutions that address the growing mental health crisis in workplaces.

**Key Factors Supporting GO:**
- Market is growing, not saturated—plenty of room for differentiated players
- Mental health at work is a WHO-recognized priority (12B working days lost annually to depression/anxiety = $1T in lost productivity)
- Global engagement crisis (only 21% engaged employees) creates demand for novel approaches
- IAM's existing hardware (interactive light panels) is unique differentiation
- Biofeedback wearables market growing at 13.6% CAGR, ready for integration
- European market expanding fastest in wearables; Netherlands well-positioned

**Key Conditions for Success:**
1. Start B2B enterprise (not consumer)—HR/Facilities buyers have budgets
2. Integrate with existing wearables (don't build own hardware beyond lights)
3. Lead with light therapy science + gamification, not "social credit" messaging
4. GDPR-compliant from day one—health data is sensitive
5. Pilot with 5-10 Dutch companies before scaling

**Market Entry Timing:** FAVORABLE—Post-COVID mental health awareness at peak, manager burnout crisis driving corporate investment, AI integration creating new possibilities.

## 4. Data Privacy Considerations

### 4.1 GDPR Requirements for Health Data

Health data is classified as **"special category data"** under GDPR Article 9, requiring:

- **Explicit consent** (not just implied)
- **Purpose limitation** — Data only used for stated wellness purposes
- **Data minimization** — Collect only necessary data
- **Right to erasure** — Employees can delete their data
- **Portability** — Employees can export their data
- **Breach notification** — 72-hour reporting requirement

**Penalties:** Up to €20M or 4% of global revenue (whichever higher)

### 4.2 Privacy-by-Design Principles for ZenithCred

| **Edge processing** | Biofeedback processed locally when possible |
| **Data residency** | EU data stays in EU |
| **Transparent algorithms** | Explain how scores are calculated |
| **No discrimination** | Wellness data cannot affect employment decisions |

### 4.3 Risk Mitigation

**Critical:** Position ZenithCred as wellness-positive, NOT surveillance.

**Messaging to Avoid:**
- ❌ "Monitor employee health"
- ❌ "Track worker productivity"  
- ❌ "Social credit scores"

**Messaging to Use:**
- ✅ "Team wellness insights"
- ✅ "Collective health celebration"
- ✅ "Opt-in wellness rewards"
