## 2. Unit Economics

### Assumptions

| Metric | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Average company size | 200 employees | Mid-market sweet spot |
| Participation rate | 65% | Opt-in, engaged subset |
| Active users per customer | 130 employees | 200 × 65% |
| Average contract value (ACV) | €28,800/year | 200 × €12 × 12 months |
| Hardware revenue per deal | €6,000 | Average installation |
| Contract length | 24 months (avg) | Annual with 2-year typical |
| Gross margin (SaaS) | 80% | Standard SaaS |
| Gross margin (Hardware) | 35% | Physical product + install |
| Blended gross margin | 72% | Weighted average |

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Fully-Loaded CAC Calculation:**

| Component | Cost | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Sales salary (allocated) | €8,000 | 25% of AE time per deal |
| Marketing cost per lead | €2,500 | 10 leads per deal, €250/lead |
| Sales tools/travel | €1,000 | CRM, demos, visits |
| Proof-of-concept | €1,500 | Pilot equipment, time |
| **Total CAC** | **€13,000** | |

**CAC Breakdown by Channel:**

| Channel | CAC | % of Deals |
|---------|-----|------------|
| Direct outbound | €15,000 | 40% |
| Inbound marketing | €10,000 | 30% |
| Partner/referral | €8,000 | 30% |
| **Blended CAC** | **€11,500** | 100% |

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**LTV Calculation:**

```
LTV = (ACV × Gross Margin) × Customer Lifetime

Where:
- ACV = €28,800 (SaaS) + €6,000 (hardware, year 1 only)
- Gross Margin = 72% blended
- Churn Rate = 15% annual (target)
- Customer Lifetime = 1/Churn = 6.67 years

Year 1 Contribution: (€28,800 + €6,000) × 72% = €25,056
Year 2+ Contribution: €28,800 × 80% (SaaS only) = €23,040/year

LTV = €25,056 + (€23,040 × 5.67) = €25,056 + €130,637 = €155,693

Conservative LTV (3-year horizon): 
= €25,056 + (€23,040 × 2) = €71,136
```

### Key Ratios

| Metric | Value | Target | Industry Benchmark |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| **LTV:CAC** | 4.8x (full) / 4.9x (3-yr) | >3x | 3-5x healthy |
| **CAC Payback** | 8.6 months | <12 months | 12-18 months typical |
| **Gross Margin** | 72% | >70% | 70-80% B2B SaaS |
| **Net Revenue Retention** | 105% (target) | >100% | 100-120% |
| **Logo Churn** | 15% (target) | <20% | 10-20% SMB |

**CAC Payback Calculation:**
```
Monthly Revenue per Customer = €28,800 / 12 = €2,400
Monthly Gross Profit = €2,400 × 72% = €1,728
CAC Payback = €13,000 / €1,728 = 7.5 months

With hardware upfront: €13,000 / ((€25,056 + €23,040) / 24) = 6.5 months
```

### Expansion Revenue Opportunities

| Expansion Type | Trigger | Additional Revenue |
|----------------|---------|-------------------|
| Seat expansion | Company growth | +€12/employee/month |
| Tier upgrade | Feature adoption | +€4-6/employee/month |
| Additional locations | Multi-site rollout | +€6,000 hardware + SaaS |
| Premium analytics | HR request | +€200-500/month |

## 6. Key Assumptions & Risks

### Assumptions (Explicit)

| Assumption | Value | Sensitivity |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| Average deal size | 200 employees | High |
| Price point achievable | €12/employee/month | High |
| Sales cycle | 3-4 months | Medium |
| Churn rate | 15% annual | High |
| Participation rate | 65% employees | Medium |
| Hardware margin | 35% | Low |
| CAC | €11,500 | Medium |
| Team cost (avg) | €70K/FTE | Low |

### Sensitivity Analysis

**If average deal size is 150 (not 200) employees:**
- ACV drops to €21,600 (from €28,800)
- Year 3 revenue: €2.96M (vs €3.95M base)
- Break-even pushed to Month 32

**If churn is 25% (not 15%):**
- LTV drops to €56,000 (3-year)
- LTV:CAC drops to 3.9x
- Still viable but tighter economics

**If CAC is €18,000 (not €11,500):**
- CAC payback extends to 12 months
- Need more capital for same growth
- Seed round should be €1.0M+

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Low employee adoption | Medium | High | Opt-in design, rewards, social features |
| Longer sales cycle | Medium | Medium | Pilot program, freemium elements |
| Hardware complexity | Medium | Medium | Partner installations, modular design |
| Competitive response | Low | Medium | First-mover in hardware-wellness, IP protection |
| GDPR compliance | Low | High | Privacy-by-design, legal review, DPO |
