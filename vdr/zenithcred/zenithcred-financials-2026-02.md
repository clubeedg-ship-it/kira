## 2. Unit Economics Per Corporate Client

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Year 1 deal value** | €31,420 | €25,920 SaaS + €5,500 HW |
| **Recurring ACV** | €25,920 | Years 2+ (SaaS only) |
| **CAC** | €20,000 | Blended across channels |
| **CAC payback** | 14 months | On gross profit basis |
| **3-year LTV** | €50,479 | With churn applied (see below) |
| **LTV:CAC** | 2.5x | Path to 3x+ as churn improves |
| **Gross profit per client Y1** | €21,366 | €19,991 SaaS GP + €1,375 HW GP |

### LTV Buildup (3-Year Conservative Horizon)

### Path to 3x+ LTV:CAC

| Lever | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Churn ↓ from 25% to 15% | LTV → €62K → 3.1x |
| Seat expansion (NRR > 100%) | LTV → €58K+ → 2.9x+ |
| CAC ↓ via referral/brand | CAC → €16K → 3.2x at current LTV |
| Combined Y3 state | **LTV:CAC ≈ 3.5x** |

| Period | Inflow | Outflow | Net | Cumulative Cash |
|--------|--------|---------|-----|-----------------|
| Pre-seed (M1-2) | €150K | €90K | +€60K | €60K |
| Seed close (M3) | €1,100K | €45K | +€1,055K | €1,115K |
| M4-M6 | €22K | €135K | -€113K | €1,002K |

| **Base** | 36+ months | €440K |
| **Optimistic** | 36+ months (cash-generative M28) | €620K |

**Buffer:** €90K reserve earmarked for unexpected costs. Even in conservative case, runway extends past 24 months — no emergency bridge needed if discipline holds.

## 5. Milestones Tied to Funding Tranches

### Tranche Structure (Suggested)

| **Tranche 3** | €220K (20%) | 15 customers + €350K ARR | Month 12-15 |

*Alternative: Full release at close if investors prefer simplicity. Tranches de-risk but add governance overhead.*

|----------|------|------|------|
| Customers won/year | 15 avg | 25 avg | 35 avg |
| ACV | €22K | €26K | €30K |
| Churn | 25% | 20% | 12% |

### Key Risk Factors

| Risk | Impact on Model | Mitigation |

| Sales cycle > 7 months | Y1 drops to 5 customers (-40% rev) | Start pilots earlier, reduce scope |
| Churn > 30% Y1 | LTV:CAC drops to 2.1x | Tighter customer selection, CS investment |
| ACV < €20K (price pressure) | Break-even pushed 6+ months | Defend value with outcome data |
| Hardware margin erosion | Blended margin drops to 62% | Shift to lease model, scale discounts |

## 7. Valuation Context

| Metric | ZenithCred (Seed) | Benchmark |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Pre-money | €2.5-3.5M | Median EU seed: €3.6M |
| Revenue multiple (on Y3 proj) | 1.6-2.2x | Corp wellness: 5-10x on ARR |

| Dilution | 24-31% | Typical seed: 20-30% |

**Series A target (M30-36):** €2-4M at €10-15M pre-money, requiring €1M+ ARR and <18% churn.
