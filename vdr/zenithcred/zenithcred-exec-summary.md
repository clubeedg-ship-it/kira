# ZenithCred — Executive Summary

**Interactive Corporate Wellness Gamification Platform**
Seed Round — February 2026

---

## 1. The Opportunity

Corporate wellness is broken. Despite €20B+ spent annually in Europe, employee engagement with wellness programs remains dismal — studies consistently show 70–80% dropout within the first quarter. The root cause: most programs are passive (apps, webinars, newsletters). They don't create behavioral change because they don't create *experiences*.

Meanwhile, the cost of employee burnout, absenteeism, and turnover continues to climb. European employers lose an estimated €136B annually to productivity losses linked to poor physical and mental health. Post-COVID, the problem has intensified — hybrid work eliminated incidental movement, and employers face growing regulatory pressure (EU Framework Directive 89/391/EEC and national transpositions) to provide meaningful workplace wellness infrastructure.

**The gap:** No existing solution combines physical interactive hardware with gamification in the corporate wellness space.

## 2. Product

ZenithCred is a full-stack corporate wellness platform with three integrated layers:

### Hardware Layer
Interactive floor and wall projection systems using commercial-grade LED panels. These transform underutilized office spaces (break rooms, lobbies, corridors) into movement-based game zones. Employees engage in short, high-energy physical activities — individually or as teams — during breaks.

The hardware is derived from **Interactive Move (IAM)**, our proven product deployed in 50+ kindergartens across the Netherlands ([interactivemove.nl](https://interactivemove.nl)). We've adapted the technology for adult use cases, corporate durability standards, and enterprise integration.

### Sensor Layer
Biofeedback wearable integration (heart rate, movement quality, exertion level) that feeds real-time data into the platform. This enables adaptive difficulty, personalized wellness scoring, and verifiable health outcomes for HR reporting.

### Software Layer (SaaS)
- **Employee app:** Gamification tokens earned through physical activity, redeemable for rewards (company perks, gift cards, PTO credits)
- **HR dashboard:** Engagement analytics, wellness ROI reporting, compliance documentation
- **Content engine:** AI-driven adaptive programming that adjusts activities based on team preferences and fitness levels

## 3. Business Model

ZenithCred operates on a **hardware lease + SaaS** model:

| Revenue Stream | Pricing | Notes |
|----------------|---------|-------|
| Hardware unit | €2,500 per unit (one-time lease setup) | Includes installation, calibration, first-year maintenance |
| SaaS platform | €500/month per corporate client | HR dashboard, employee app, content library, analytics |

**Unit economics per client (Year 1):**
- Hardware revenue: €2,500
- SaaS revenue: €6,000 (12 months)
- **Total Year 1 revenue per client: €8,500**
- Estimated gross margin: 65–70%

**Expansion revenue:** Multi-location clients add additional hardware units (avg. 2.3 units per client by Year 2, based on kindergarten deployment patterns).

## 4. Financial Projections (Conservative)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Corporate clients | 50 | 200 | 500 |
| Hardware units deployed | 60 | 300 | 800 |
| ARR (SaaS) | €300K | €1.2M | €3.0M |
| Hardware revenue | €150K | €600K | €1.5M |
| **Total revenue** | **€450K** | **€1.8M** | **€4.5M** |
| Gross margin | 60% | 67% | 72% |
| EBITDA | -€500K | -€100K | €800K |

*Assumptions: 12-month average sales cycle shortening to 6 months by Year 2. 5% monthly churn Year 1, decreasing to 3% Year 2. No multi-unit expansion included in conservative case.*

## 5. Go-to-Market

**Phase 1 (Year 1): Netherlands + Belgium**
- Direct sales to mid-market corporates (200–2,000 employees)
- Channel: HR director outreach, wellness conferences, IAM referral network
- 3 signed LOIs from Dutch corporates for Q2 2026 pilot deployment

**Phase 2 (Year 2): Germany + Nordics**
- Partner with corporate wellness consultancies and facility management companies
- Leverage EU workplace directive compliance as a sales accelerator

**Phase 3 (Year 3): UK + Southern Europe**
- Establish channel partner network for scalable distribution
- Explore integration partnerships with existing HR platforms (Personio, HiBob)

## 6. Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Approach | ZenithCred Differentiator |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------|
| **Virgin Pulse** | App-based wellness platform | Software only — no physical engagement hardware |
| **Wellable** | Wellness challenges + app | Digital-first, no on-site infrastructure |
| **ClassPass Corporate** | Gym membership aggregator | Off-site; doesn't activate the office itself |
| **Gympass/Wellhub** | Fitness benefit marketplace | Purely transactional; no gamification loop |

**Our moat:** ZenithCred is the only solution that places interactive physical hardware *inside the workplace* and ties it to a gamification economy. This creates:
1. **Switching costs** — hardware is installed, calibrated, and integrated into office spaces
2. **Data moat** — biofeedback data improves our AI content engine over time
3. **Network effects** — gamification tokens create intra-company social dynamics

We acknowledge this is early stage. The moat deepens with deployment volume.

## 7. Team

**Otto — Founder & CEO**

## 9. Why ZenithCred, Why Now

The corporate wellness market is large and growing, but stale. Everyone is building another app. ZenithCred bets that *physical, in-office, social, gamified experiences* drive real engagement — and we have the proven hardware platform to deliver it.

We're early. We're honest about that. But we have working hardware, real deployment experience, and a clear path to revenue. The opportunity to own the intersection of physical interactive technology and corporate wellness is open — and it won't stay open long.
