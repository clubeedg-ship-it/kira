## Email 1A: Warm Intro Version

**When to use:** When you have a mutual connection who can make the introduction.

**Subject:** Intro request: ZenithCred — workplace wellness meets interactive lighting (seed)

---

**To the introducer:**

Hi [INTRODUCER NAME],

Quick favor — would you be comfortable introducing me to [INVESTOR NAME] at [FUND]?

We're raising a €1.1M seed for ZenithCred. We've built interactive light panels that respond to team wellness metrics — biofeedback from Oura/WHOOP drives the office lighting, gamified team challenges keep people engaged. Think "the office that cares about your health."

Why [FUND]: [ONE-SENTENCE THESIS FIT — e.g., "Their focus on health & wellbeing SDGs is exactly our mission" or "Their HR-tech mandate aligns perfectly with our corporate wellness platform"].

We have 3 paying pilots in the Netherlands, 15+ qualified prospects, and a clear path to €1.7M ARR by Year 3.

Happy to send a short blurb you can forward, or I can draft the intro email for you.

Thanks,
Otto

## Email 1B: Cold Outreach Version

**When to use:** No mutual connection. Direct outreach to investor.

**Subject Line Options (test 2-3):**
- A: "The office that glows healthier as your team does — €1.1M seed"
- B: "Workplace wellness is broken. Here's what physical infrastructure changes."
- C: "[FUND NAME] + corporate wellness hardware — quick fit check?"

---

Hi [INVESTOR FIRST NAME],

I noticed [FUND]'s investment in [PORTFOLIO COMPANY / recent thesis post / event talk] — [ONE SENTENCE connecting their work to ZenithCred's space].

I'm Otto, co-founder of ZenithCred. We're building physical wellness infrastructure for offices — interactive light panels that respond to team biofeedback data, gamified with team challenges.

**The problem:** 79% of employees are disengaged (Gallup 2024). Wellness apps see declining usage after month one. Digital-only solutions don't create lasting behavior change.

**Our approach:** Hardware + software. Interactive light panels deliver 10,000 lux therapeutic lighting that responds to team wellness metrics from Oura/WHOOP. Office walls literally glow healthier as the team does. Points, challenges, rewards keep engagement high.

**Where we are:**
- 3 paying pilot customers in the Netherlands
- 15+ qualified prospects in pipeline
- €12/employee/month SaaS + hardware (68% blended gross margin)
- No direct competitor combines light panels + gamification + biofeedback + B2B

We're raising €1.1M seed at €2.5-3.5M pre-money for 24 months of runway to reach ~28 customers and €725K ARR.

Would 20 minutes make sense to explore fit? I can share our deck and financial model ahead of the call.

Best,
Otto van [Last Name]

### Personalization Notes for Email 1B by Investor Type:

**For health-tech VCs (LUMO Labs, Calm/Storm, NLC Health):**
> "I noticed [FUND]'s focus on health & wellbeing — specifically your investment in [PORTFOLIO CO]. ZenithCred sits at the same intersection: using technology to improve health outcomes, but in the workplace rather than clinical settings."

**For B2B SaaS VCs (Newion, henQ, Peak):**
> "I saw [FUND]'s thesis on B2B SaaS with strong unit economics. ZenithCred has a compelling SaaS model — €12/employee/month recurring revenue with 78% SaaS gross margins, and hardware creates natural switching costs that pure-software competitors can't match."

**For HR-tech / Corporate VCs (Randstad IF, SAP.iO):**
> "Given [FUND]'s mission to shape the future of work, I wanted to share what we're building. ZenithCred turns the physical office into an active participant in employee wellness — directly addressing the engagement crisis your portfolio companies' clients face."

**For impact investors (Ananda, LUMO Labs):**
> "ZenithCred directly addresses SDG 3 (Good Health & Wellbeing) in the workplace. The WHO estimates 12 billion working days lost annually to depression and anxiety — our light therapy + gamification approach is clinically grounded and measurably impactful."

**For corporate VCs / insurers (Achmea Innovation Fund):**
> "Prevention is cheaper than treatment. ZenithCred gives your corporate health clients a measurable tool to reduce absenteeism and improve mental wellness — the kind of outcomes that directly impact claims ratios."

## Email 2: Follow-Up with Traction/Data Hook

**Timing:** 5-7 business days after Email 1 (if no response)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject] — quick data point from our pilots

---

Hi [INVESTOR FIRST NAME],

Following up on my note last week. Wanted to share a quick update:

**[Choose the most relevant data point — update with real pilot data as available:]**

- Option A: "Our first pilot customer (200 employees, Dutch tech company) hit [X]% daily engagement rate in week 3 — significantly above the industry average of ~15% for wellness apps."
- Option B: "We just signed our [X]th pilot customer — [COMPANY TYPE] in [CITY]. They chose us over Headspace for Work specifically because of the physical light panel integration."
- Option C: "HR director at our pilot site told us: '[QUOTE FROM CUSTOMER ABOUT IMPACT].' That's the response you can't get from another screen."
- Option D: "We analyzed the first [X] weeks of pilot data: [SPECIFIC METRIC — e.g., '40% of employees used the system daily' or 'Team light panel interactions averaged X per day']."

The core insight we're proving: **physical wellness infrastructure creates fundamentally different engagement than software-only solutions.** Ambient, persistent, social — not another app notification.

Happy to walk you through our pilot results and financial model in 20 minutes. [CALENDLY LINK]

Best,
Otto

## Email 3: Final Nudge with Urgency

**Timing:** 7-10 business days after Email 2 (if no response)

**Subject:** Closing in 3 weeks — last note on ZenithCred (€1.1M seed)

---

Hi [INVESTOR FIRST NAME],

Last note from me — I respect your inbox.

We're closing our €1.1M seed round in [MONTH]. We have [X]% committed and are finalizing the last allocations.

**Three reasons this might still be worth 20 minutes:**

1. **Blue ocean:** We've found no direct competitor combining interactive light panels + gamification + biofeedback in B2B corporate wellness. First-mover with hardware creates real switching costs.

2. **Timing:** Post-COVID mental health crisis, Gallup's 2024 manager engagement drop (steepest ever), and the return-to-office trend create a perfect storm for "the office that cares about you."

3. **Capital efficiency:** €1.1M gets us to 28 customers and €725K ARR in 24 months. Monthly cash-flow positive by month 32. We're not burning cash on user acquisition — enterprise B2B with hardware lock-in.

If the timing isn't right for [FUND], I'd also welcome an introduction to anyone in your network who focuses on [health-tech / HR-tech / workplace innovation]. Happy to return the favor.

Either way — thanks for your time.

Best,
Otto van [Last Name]
CEO & Co-Founder, ZenithCred

## Outreach Cadence & Best Practices

### Weekly Rhythm
- **Monday:** Send 5-8 new Email 1s (mix of warm and cold)
- **Wednesday:** Send Email 2 follow-ups for previous week's batch
- **Friday:** Send Email 3 final nudges; review responses and schedule calls

### Response Rate Benchmarks
- Cold outreach: Expect 5-10% response rate
- Warm intros: Expect 25-40% response rate
- Target: 50+ investors contacted → 10-15 meetings → 3-5 term sheets → select best partner

### General Tips
1. **Personalize every email** — generic blasts get deleted. 30 seconds of research shows
2. **Keep it short** — investors skim. Your email should be readable in 30 seconds
3. **Lead with what makes you different** — "interactive light panels" is memorable; "corporate wellness platform" is not
4. **Include a specific ask** — "20 minutes" is better than "would love to connect"
5. **Send Tuesday-Thursday 9-11am** in recipient's time zone
6. **Track everything** — use HubSpot CRM to log every touchpoint
7. **Don't apologize for following up** — it's expected in fundraising
8. **Attach deck only when requested** — reference it, don't send unsolicited

### LinkedIn Parallel Track
For every email sent, also:
1. Connect with the investor on LinkedIn (no message, just connect)
2. Like/comment on their recent posts (genuine engagement)
3. After Email 2 with no response, send a brief LinkedIn DM: "Hi [Name], sent you a note about ZenithCred — workplace wellness hardware. Would love a quick fit check if it's relevant to [FUND]'s thesis."
