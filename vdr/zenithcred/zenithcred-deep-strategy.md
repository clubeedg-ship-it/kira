# ZenithCred — Deep Strategy
*Kira | Feb 8, 2026*

## Seed Round Strategy

### Target Round
- **Amount:** €1.1M
- **Valuation:** €2.5-3.5M pre-money (€3.6-4.6M post-money)
- **Instrument:** SAFE or convertible note preferred (faster close, less negotiation)
- **Dilution:** ~24-30%

### What Investors Need to See

**Minimum for seed in 2026:**
1. **MVP/Demo:** Working prototype showing the core value prop (light panels + gamification dashboard)
2. **LOIs:** 2-3 letters of intent from companies saying "we'd pay for this"
3. **Team:** At minimum, Otto + 1 technical co-founder or senior dev
4. **Market data:** The corp wellness market research we already have (~€25-27B Europe = 39.5% of ~$68B global market — verified IMARC/Grand View Research 2025)
5. **Unit economics model:** Our v2 business model doc (corrected math)
6. **Competitive differentiation:** Why not just Wellable/Virgin Pulse/Headspace for Work?

**What's missing right now:**
- No MVP (critical gap)
- No LOIs 
- No co-founder
- The pitch deck speaker notes exist but need the actual deck

### Investor Meeting Prep Checklist
- [ ] Pitch deck: 12 slides, clean design (Problem → Solution → Market → Product → Traction → Team → Ask)
- [ ] Product demo video (even if mockup/prototype)
- [ ] Financial model spreadsheet (3-year projections, already in v2 doc)
- [ ] 2-3 LOIs from potential pilot companies
- [ ] Data room: business model, market research, technical architecture

### Timeline to Close
- Feb: Finalize pitch deck + build basic demo
- Mar: Begin investor outreach (target list of 30+ already compiled)
- Apr: First meetings, iterate on feedback
- May: Term sheet + close
- Jun: Money in bank

## Corporate Wellness Market Entry

### Pilot → Enterprise Sales Cycle

**Phase 1: Pilot (free/subsidized)**
- Offer 3-month free pilot to 2-3 companies
- Target: 100-300 employee companies in Randstad
- Measure: Employee engagement scores, usage rates, satisfaction
- Film testimonial content

**Phase 2: Case Study**
- Publish results: "X% improvement in wellness scores"
- Use as sales collateral for next 10 customers

**Phase 3: Enterprise Sales**
- Enterprise sales cycle = 3-6 months
- Decision makers: HR directors, wellness managers, C-suite
- Budget cycle: Q4 (plan) → Q1 (execute) = align outreach with this
- Expected contract size: €30-50K/year per company (100-300 employees)

### Competitive Landscape
- **Wellable:** Wellness challenges, rewards. No hardware component.
- **Virgin Pulse:** Enterprise wellness. Very large, expensive.
- **Headspace for Work:** Meditation/mindfulness focus.
- **ZenithCred differentiator:** Physical hardware (light panels) + gamification + biofeedback. Multi-sensory. Unique.

## Token Economics

**Recommendation: Not now.** 

Token economics adds complexity and regulatory risk. For seed round:
- Focus on SaaS metrics (ARR, churn, CAC, LTV)
- Tokens can be explored post-Series A if there's a clear utility
- If tokenizing: could be reward tokens within the platform (earned by wellness activities, spent on perks)
- Would need legal opinion on MiCA (EU crypto regulation)

---

## Honest Assessment
ZenithCred is a solid seed-stage wellness tech company. The hardware differentiator is real. But:
- It needs an MVP desperately
- One-person team is a red flag for investors
- The €1.1M seed is achievable but not easy without traction
- Best path: build a basic demo, get 2 LOIs, then fundraise

**Valuation ceiling by Oct 2026: €3.5-5M (post-seed)**
