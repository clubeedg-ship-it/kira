## Slide 2: The Problem - Corporate Wellness Crisis

### The Three-Layer Crisis Facing Employers Today

**🔴 Layer 1: Employee Engagement at Historic Lows**
- Only **21% of global employees are engaged** (Gallup 2024)
- Manager engagement dropped from 30% to 27% in 2024 — steepest decline ever
- 70% of team engagement is attributable to the manager

**🔴 Layer 2: Mental Health Costs Soaring**  
- **12 billion working days lost annually** to depression/anxiety = **$1T in lost productivity** (WHO)
- 15% of working-age adults have a mental disorder
- Post-COVID mental health crisis accelerating

**🔴 Layer 3: Existing Solutions Fail**
- Wellness apps see declining usage after first month
- Screen-based solutions don't create lasting behavior change
- Physical workspace disconnect — hybrid/remote work means office needs compelling wellness experience

### Market Validation
- Corporate wellness market growing **7.41% CAGR** ($63.68B in 2024 → $129.44B by 2034)
- European wearables market growing fastest globally (**25%+ CAGR**)
- Netherlands: **~12,000 companies** in target segment (100-500 employees)
