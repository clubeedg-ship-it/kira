# ZenithCred — Investor One-Pager

**Corporate Wellness Through Interactive Gamification**
Seed Round | €1.1M | Q1 2026

---

## The Problem

Corporate wellness programs fail. 80% of employees disengage within 3 months. Why? They're passive — apps, webinars, step counters. Nobody moves. Burnout costs European employers €136B/year in lost productivity, and existing solutions feel like homework.

## The Solution

ZenithCred transforms office spaces into interactive wellness arenas. Our platform combines:

- **Interactive floor/wall projectors** (LED panels) that turn break rooms into movement-based game zones
- **Biofeedback sensors** that track real-time physiological engagement (heart rate, movement quality)
- **Gamification tokens** — employees earn, trade, and redeem wellness credits tied to actual physical activity

Think: arcade meets corporate wellness. Employees *want* to use it.

## Why Now

- **Post-COVID mandate shift:** Remote/hybrid work created a physical wellness crisis; employers are now mandated to invest in on-site wellness (EU Framework Directive 89/391/EEC updates)
- **EU Workplace Health Directives** are tightening — companies face compliance pressure to provide active wellness infrastructure
- **Hardware costs dropped 40%** since 2020 — interactive projection systems are now commercially viable at scale

## Market

European corporate wellness market: **€23.6B by 2030** (3% CAGR). Hardware-integrated wellness is an underserved niche — current spend is 90% software-only.

## Traction

- **Proven hardware:** Built on Interactive Move (IAM) — deployed in 50+ kindergartens across the Netherlands ([interactivemove.nl](https://interactivemove.nl))
- **Corporate pilots:** 3 LOIs from Dutch corporates for Q2 2026 deployment
- **Working prototype:** Full-stack system (projectors + sensors + token platform) in testing

## Business Model
