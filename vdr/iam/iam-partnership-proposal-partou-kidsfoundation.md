# Partnership Proposal: InterActiveMove × Partou / KidsFoundation

**Prepared by:** Oopuo — on behalf of Inter Active Move B.V.
**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Classification:** Confidential

## 1. Executive Summary

Inter Active Move B.V. (IAM) develops interactive floor and wall projection systems that transform how children move, learn, and play. With 500+ installations, 10+ years of experience, and 98% customer satisfaction, IAM is the leading Dutch provider of interactive projection technology for childcare environments.

We propose a strategic partnership with **Partou** (~700 locations) and **KidsFoundation** (~500 locations) to deploy IAM interactive systems across your networks — beginning with a no-risk pilot program and scaling to a full rollout with volume-based pricing.

**The core proposition:** For less than the cost of one day of childcare per month (€199–€299), each location gains a differentiation tool that drives new enrollments, reduces toy replacement costs, supports pedagogical goals, and delights both children and parents.

**One additional enrollment per year pays for the system 4× over.**

## 2. Problem Statement

### Children Are Moving Less
Dutch children spend increasing time on screens. The Kenniscentrum Sport & Bewegen reports that a majority of young children do not meet daily physical activity guidelines. Childcare centers — where children spend 8–10 hours daily — are a critical intervention point.

### Differentiation Pressure
The Dutch childcare market is competitive. With ~9,315 kinderdagverblijven nationwide, parents compare locations on quality, innovation, and engagement. Traditional play equipment wears out, requires constant replacement (€500–€1,500/year), and offers limited variety.

### Pedagogical Demands
GGD inspections and VVE (Voorschoolse en Vroegschoolse Educatie) programs require documented developmental activities. Staff spend significant time preparing activities and managing transitions — time that could be better supported by smart tools.

### The Opportunity for Large Chains
Partou and KidsFoundation, as market leaders, are uniquely positioned to set the standard for innovation in Dutch childcare. A technology partnership at scale creates competitive moats that independent operators cannot easily replicate.

## 3. IAM Solution Overview

### What It Is
IAM systems project interactive games onto floors or walls. Built-in motion sensors detect children's movement — running, jumping, stepping, touching — and the projected content responds in real time. **No tablets. No screens. Pure physical play combined with educational content.**

### Product Range

| Product | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Interactieve Vloer** | Ceiling-mounted projector with floor projection | Activity rooms, hallways |
| **Interactieve Muur** | Wall-mounted interactive projection | Smaller spaces, corridors |
| **Interactieve Zandbak** | AR sandbox with topographic projections | Sensory play areas |
| **Interactieve Klimwand** | Gamified climbing wall projection | Active play zones |
| **Mobiele Vloer** | Portable system for events and shared use | Multi-location rotation |

### Content Library
- **60+ games** available, growing continuously
- Categories: gross motor, fine motor, cognitive (counting, colors, patterns, memory), social-emotional (cooperation, turn-taking)
- Age range: **0–12 years**, inclusive of children with disabilities
- Automatic software updates with seasonal themes and new games
- Custom game creation available via IAM Game Editor

### Key Differentiators

| Feature | IAM | Traditional Play Equipment |
|---------|-----|---------------------------|
| Variety | 60+ games, always expanding | 10–20 fixed options |
| Maintenance | Zero — digital content, no parts | Cleaning, repair, replacement |
| Safety | No physical components, no wear | Wear risks, small parts |
| Freshness | Automatic updates | Static until replaced |
| Pedagogical tracking | Activity-aligned to VE goals | Manual documentation only |
| Installation | 1–2 hours, no renovation needed | Days/weeks for play areas |

### Privacy & Safety
- **No cameras, no recording** — motion sensors detect movement only
- No personal data collection from children
- CE-certified equipment
- Minimal physical safety risk (no loose parts, no wear)

## 4. Partnership Structure

We propose a phased approach that minimizes risk and maximizes learning at each stage.

### Phase 1: Pilot Program (Month 1–3)
- **Scope:** 2–4 locations per chain (4–8 total)
- **Duration:** 4 weeks free trial per location, followed by 8-week paid evaluation
- **Selection criteria:** Mix of urban/suburban, different age groups, varying room sizes
- **What IAM provides:**
  - Full system installation at no cost during trial
  - Staff training (30-minute on-site introduction)
  - Daily usage tracking tools and weekly check-ins
  - Dedicated account manager
- **What we measure:**
  - Daily usage hours and child participation
  - Staff adoption and ease of use
  - Parent feedback and reactions
  - Impact on enrollment inquiries during pilot period
  - Pedagogical alignment (VE goals, GGD relevance)
- **Decision point:** End of Month 3 — joint review of pilot data

### Phase 2: Initial Rollout (Month 4–9)
- **Scope:** 25–50 locations per chain
- **Model:** Lease agreement with volume pricing (see Section 5)
- **Rollout pace:** 8–12 installations per month
- **Support:** Regional support structure, quarterly content reviews

### Phase 3: Full Network Deployment (Month 10–24)
- **Scope:** Remaining locations based on suitability assessment
- **Target:** 200–400+ systems across both chains
- **Model:** Multi-year framework agreement with annual pricing reviews
- **Added value:** Co-development of custom content aligned to chain-specific pedagogical programs

### Optional: Co-Branding & Exclusivity
For a commitment of 100+ units, IAM offers:
- Co-branded game content (Partou/KidsFoundation themed games)

## 6. ROI for Kindergarten Chains

### Break-Even Analysis

```
Monthly IAM cost per location:                    €261 (at 100+ unit pricing)
÷ Average monthly revenue per child:              €1,500
= Break-even:                                     0.17 additional child

→ Less than one-fifth of one extra enrollment covers the entire cost.
```

### Revenue Impact

| Driver | Conservative | Realistic | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Additional enrollments per location/year | +1 | +2 | +4 |
| Extra annual revenue per location | €18,000 | €36,000 | €72,000 |
| Annual IAM cost (100+ pricing) | €3,132 | €3,132 | €3,132 |
| **Net ROI per location** | **€14,868** | **€32,868** | **€68,868** |
| **ROI multiple** | **5.7×** | **11.5×** | **23×** |

### At Chain Scale (200 locations)

| Scenario | 3-Year Extra Revenue | 3-Year IAM Cost | **Net Value** |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Conservative (+1 child/location) | €10.8M | €1.88M | **+€8.92M** |
| Realistic (+2 children/location) | €21.6M | €1.88M | **+€19.72M** |

### Cost Savings

| Category | Annual Saving per Location |
|----------|---------------------------|

| Staff time efficiency (2–4 hrs/week × €25/hr) | €2,600–€5,200 |
| Reduced activity preparation time | €500–€1,000 |
| **Total operational savings** | **€3,600–€7,700/year** |

### Intangible Benefits
