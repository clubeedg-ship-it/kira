## Market Size — Netherlands Kindergartens

### The Numbers
- **Kinderdagverblijven (daycare 0-4):** **9,315 locations** (CBS, October 2024 — verified via Stichting Lezen/CBS report)
- **BSO (after-school care 4-12):** ~5,000-6,000 locations
- **Peuterspeelzalen (merged into KDV since 2018):** included above
- **Total childcare locations:** ~15,000-16,000 in the Netherlands
- **Major chains:** Partou (~700 locations), KidsFoundation (~500), Smallsteps (~400), Kinderrijk (~200), CompaNanny (~100)

### Tech Budget Reality
- Average kindergarten has **very limited tech budget** — maybe €2,000-5,000/year for all technology
- Interactive/educational tech is a **"nice to have"** not a necessity
- Government subsidies (VVE programs) can partially fund educational tech
- Municipality budgets for early childhood education: varies €500-2,000 per child/year

### Addressable Market
- Target: kinderdagverblijven that are progressive, urban, chain-operated
- Realistic addressable: ~3,000-4,000 locations (chains + progressive independents)
- At €249/mo average lease: 3,000 × €249 × 12 = **€8.96M total addressable in NL**

## Partnership Strategy

### Tier 1: Large Chains (biggest impact)
1. **Partou** (~700 locations) — Largest chain. One deal = massive scale. Contact: Central procurement.
2. **KidsFoundation** (~500) — Second largest. Similar approach.
3. **Smallsteps** (~400) — Third.

**Approach:** Offer 2-4 week free trial at 1-2 locations. Film results. Present data to chain management. Pitch bulk deals (50+ units at discount).

### Tier 2: Municipal Programs
- Many municipalities fund VVE (Voorschoolse en Vroegschoolse Educatie)
- IAM can position as educational tech that qualifies for VVE budgets
- Target: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Den Haag, Utrecht first

### Tier 3: Progressive Independents
- Already have the prospect list (50+ from yesterday's research)
- Direct outreach via email templates
- Focus on urban, upscale neighborhoods where parents expect tech

### Franchise/Group Buying
- Brancheorganisatie Kinderopvang (industry association) — get listed as recommended supplier
- BOinK (parents' organization) — endorsement = trust
