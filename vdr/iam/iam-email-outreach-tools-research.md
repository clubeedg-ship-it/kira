## 5. Netherlands-Specific Considerations

### 🇪🇺 GDPR Compliance for Cold Email

**Key Legal Basis for B2B Cold Email in Netherlands:**

1. **Legitimate Interest (Art. 6(1)(f))** - Most applicable for B2B
   - You can email business contacts if you have a legitimate interest
   - The recipient must be able to opt-out easily
   - Must be relevant to their professional role

2. **What's Allowed:**
   - Emailing general info@ or contact@ addresses ✅
   - Emailing named business contacts in professional context ✅
   - Following up 1-2 times if no response ✅

3. **What's NOT Allowed:**
   - Buying personal email lists without consent ❌
   - Continuing after explicit opt-out ❌
   - Hiding sender identity ❌
   - Misleading subject lines ❌

### 📧 Best Practices for Dutch Schools

1. **Use Professional Emails:**
   - Target info@schoolname.nl, administratie@schoolname.nl
   - Avoid personal teacher emails unless publicly listed for business

2. **Dutch Language Required:**
   - All platforms support sending in Dutch ✅
   - Personalize: "Beste [School Name]" or "Geachte"
   - Keep formal but friendly (Dutch business culture)

3. **Include Required Elements:**
   - Your company name and KvK number
   - Physical address
   - Clear opt-out link: "Uitschrijven"
   - Why you're contacting them (legitimate interest)

4. **Deliverability Tips for .nl Domains:**
   - Warm up gradually (start with 10-20/day)
   - Don't spam educational domains (they flag quickly)
   - Use a .nl sending domain if possible
   - Authenticate: SPF, DKIM, DMARC required

### 🏫 Finding Dutch School Data

**Search Terms for Outscraper/Google Maps:**
- "kinderdagverblijf" (daycare)
- "basisschool" (primary school)
- "peuterspeelzaal" (preschool)
