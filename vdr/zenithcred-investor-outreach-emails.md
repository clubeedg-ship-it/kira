# ZenithCred — Investor Outreach Email Sequence

**Target:** Seed round €1.1M | Pre-money €2.5-3.5M
**Product:** Corporate wellness gamification — light panels + biofeedback + gamification tokens
**Origin:** Born from Interactive Move's hardware (proven in kindergartens, now pivoting to corporate wellness)

## Email 1: Cold Intro (Day 0)

**Subject:** Corporate wellness is broken — we're fixing it with light + gamification

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Fund Name]'s investment in [Portfolio Company] — your thesis around [health-tech / future of work / wellness] is exactly why I'm reaching out.

**ZenithCred** turns office spaces into wellness environments using interactive light panels, biofeedback sensors, and a gamification layer that actually keeps employees engaged.

The problem: corporate wellness programs have 80% dropout rates after 3 months. Yoga rooms sit empty. App subscriptions go unused. Meanwhile, burnout costs EU employers €272B annually.

Our approach: embed wellness into the physical workspace. Employees earn tokens for micro-wellness moments — a 2-minute breathing exercise triggered by biofeedric stress signals, a walking meeting with light-guided paths, team challenges on interactive walls.

**Traction:**
- Hardware proven across 50+ installations (via our sister company Interactive Move)
- 3 corporate pilot LOIs signed
- €1.1M seed round open, €2.5M pre-money

Would 20 minutes next week work to walk you through the demo?

Best,
Otto
Founder, ZenithCred (Oopuo Group)

## Email 2: Follow-up Value Add (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Corporate wellness is broken — the numbers

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up with some context on why we think timing matters:

- EU corporate wellness market: €47B by 2028 (12% CAGR)
- Netherlands alone: mandatory ARBO wellness compliance creates built-in demand
- Hardware moat: our interactive panels are manufactured and deployed — not vaporware
- Unit economics: €15K average installation + €200/mo SaaS per location

We're not building another meditation app. We're building physical infrastructure that companies can't unsubscribe from.

Happy to share our deck if there's interest.

## Email 3: Social Proof / Scarcity (Day 8)

**Subject:** Re: Corporate wellness is broken — round update

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to share a quick update: we've had conversations with [X] funds this month and are targeting close by [date].

Two things that resonated with other investors:
1. **Hardware + SaaS hybrid** — 85% gross margins on the software layer, hardware creates switching costs
2. **Kindergarten-to-corporate pipeline** — our sister company (Interactive Move) has 50+ installations proving the hardware works. ZenithCred is the enterprise play.

If this isn't a fit for [Fund Name], I'd appreciate a warm intro to anyone in your network focused on health-tech or future-of-work.

Best,
Otto

## Email 4: Breakup (Day 14)

**Subject:** Re: Corporate wellness is broken — closing the loop

Hi [First Name],

I know inboxes are brutal, so I'll keep this short.

If ZenithCred isn't a fit right now, no hard feelings — I'd just love to know so I can focus energy elsewhere.

If timing is the issue, happy to reconnect next quarter. We'll have pilot data by then.

Thanks for your time either way.
