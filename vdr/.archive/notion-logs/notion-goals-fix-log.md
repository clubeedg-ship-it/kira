# Notion Goals Duplicate Fix Log
**Date:** 2026-02-07 17:55 UTC

## Problem
Two goals databases with overlapping content:
1. OLD "Goals" DB (`2fba6c94-88ca-81b3-9f46-000ba63ca67c`) — 12 items (5 old + 7 cascade)
2. NEW "🎯 Goal Cascade" DB (`300a6c94-88ca-816d-95a2-000be4fb068c`) — 7 duplicate items

## Actions Taken

### Step 1: Renamed OLD Goals DB → "🎯 Goal Cascade" ✅
- PATCH `/data_sources/2fba6c94...` with new title

### Step 2: Updated 5 old goals with Level (and Company where applicable) ✅
| Goal | Level | Company |
|------|-------|---------|
| Grow Abura Sales | 📅 6-Month Goal | (none - Abura not in Companies DB) |
| Close ZenithCred Investment Round | 📅 6-Month Goal | ZenithCred (`300a6c94-88ca-81db-bb93-f124cabe902e`) |
| Launch OTTOGEN.IO Website | 🗓️ 3-Month Objective | Otto (`300a6c94-88ca-8163-be7b-fe202976c026`) |
| Launch IAM Website Rebrand | 🗓️ 3-Month Objective | IAM (`300a6c94-88ca-81f9-a3d7-fe4f215ab5b5`) |
| Launch Bot Triagem MVP | 🗓️ 3-Month Objective | (none - no company match) |

### Step 3: Archived all 7 duplicate items in NEW DB ✅
Archived pages:
- `300a6c94-88ca-8117-9a67-c9c5c8a6603e`
- `300a6c94-88ca-817b-a86b-c27996f60e12`
- `300a6c94-88ca-818b-856b-c61722711fbd`
- `300a6c94-88ca-81b4-89a7-f8afef14ffa2`
- `300a6c94-88ca-81c2-b2ec-e42ff611d1e7`
- `300a6c94-88ca-81d8-ae04-ecc5d148fe2f`
- `300a6c94-88ca-81ea-8cb2-d07915097736`

### Step 4: Archived NEW Goal Cascade DATABASE ✅
- PATCH `/data_sources/300a6c94-88ca-816d-95a2-000be4fb068c` with `{"archived": true}`
- Note: Archived directly rather than moving to Archive page (archive flag is sufficient)

### Step 5: Verification ✅
All 12 goals in renamed "🎯 Goal Cascade" DB have Level set. Company linked where applicable.

## Final State
Single "🎯 Goal Cascade" DB (`2fba6c94-88ca-81b3-9f46-000ba63ca67c`) with 12 goals, all with Level and Company (where applicable). Duplicate DB archived.
