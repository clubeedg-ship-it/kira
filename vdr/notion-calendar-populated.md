## Notes

- **Abura Sales**: The Projects database doesn't have a Notes/Description property. Weekly Monday check would need to be added as a page content block or a new property.
- **CuttingEdge - SOP**: Left without end date since it's waiting for external feedback.
- **Archive filter**: Only active projects (Archive ≠ true) were processed.
