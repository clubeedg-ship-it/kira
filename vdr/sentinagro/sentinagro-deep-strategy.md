# SentinAgro — Deep Strategy
*Kira | Feb 8, 2026*

---

## Is This a Distraction? YES.

**Blunt assessment:** SentinAgro is a cool idea that has zero place in the next 8 months.

### Why Park It
1. **No product, no prototype, no pilot** — It's an idea, not a company
2. **Drone cattle monitoring requires:** Hardware R&D, regulatory approval (EASA drone regs), agricultural partnerships, field testing. This is 12-24 months of dedicated work minimum.
3. **Otto's bandwidth:** Already stretched across 4+ active companies. Adding SentinAgro = death by a thousand cuts.
4. **No revenue path in 8 months:** Zero. Literally zero.
5. **AgTech funding requires:** Pilot data from actual farms. No investor funds an idea in this space.

### The Minimum Viable Path (if you MUST)
If Otto feels strongly about keeping it alive:
- Write a one-page concept document (Kira can do this)
- Register the domain/social media handles
- File it away for Q1 2027 exploration
- Total time investment: 2 hours, then forget about it

## Recommendation
**STATUS: PARKED.** Revisit January 2027 at the earliest, and only if Chimera/ZenithCred funding creates bandwidth for exploration.
