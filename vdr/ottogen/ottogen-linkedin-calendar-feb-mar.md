### Mon Feb 16 — 💡 Thought Leadership
**"The AI gap nobody talks about"**

95% of Dutch businesses say they've "adopted AI."

Only 5% see real ROI from it.

That's not an adoption problem. That's an implementation problem.

I talk to SMB owners every week. The pattern is always the same:

→ They bought a ChatGPT subscription
→ Maybe tried some automations
→ Got busy, forgot about it
→ Now they feel "behind" but don't know where to start

The gap between having AI tools and getting AI results is where businesses leave €50K+ on the table every year.

Here's what actually closes that gap:
1. Start with ONE workflow that costs you the most time
2. Measure how many hours/week it takes today
3. Automate the repeatable parts (not the thinking parts)
4. Measure again after 2 weeks

That's it. No "digital transformation." No 6-month roadmap. Just find the bottleneck and fix it.

What's the most time-consuming repetitive task in your business right now? 👇

### Wed Feb 18 — 📊 Case Study
**"How a recruitment agency got 12 hours back per week"**

A recruitment firm in Amsterdam was spending 3+ hours/day screening CVs manually.

Their process:
- Open email → download CV → read → compare to job spec → type notes → next

Repeat 40-60 times per day.

We built an AI workflow that:
🔹 Reads every incoming CV automatically
🔹 Scores against job requirements (skills, experience, culture fit)
🔹 Flags top 20% for human review
🔹 Auto-sends personalised "thank you" to the rest

Time saved: 12 hours/week.
Cost of the automation: less than 1 hour of a recruiter's salary per month.
ROI positive: week three.

The recruiter didn't lose her job. She started doing more interviews and closed 30% more placements.

AI doesn't replace your people. It removes the work your people shouldn't be doing.

### Fri Feb 20 — 🧑 Personal Story
**"I'm 20. I automate businesses for a living. Here's how that happened."**

Two years ago I moved to the Netherlands alone.

No degree. No network. No startup funding. No fallback plan.

I slept on floors. Built PCs from scraps. Taught myself machine learning from YouTube and papers at 3am.

Not because I had a "passion for AI." Because I saw something:

Most businesses are running on human duct tape.

Smart people doing repetitive work because "that's how we've always done it." Copy-paste. Manual data entry. The same email written 50 times a week.

I thought: I can fix this.

So I started building automations for small businesses. Not billion-dollar enterprise contracts — real companies with 5-50 employees who actually feel the difference.

Now I run OttoGen — AI consulting for SMBs in the Netherlands.

No venture capital. No 50-person team. Just me, my AI systems, and the results I deliver.

If you're an SMB owner curious about what AI can actually do for YOUR specific business — I'm always happy to chat. No pitch, just honest advice.

What would you do with 10 extra hours per week? 👇

### Mon Feb 23 — 💡 Thought Leadership
**"5 AI automations every SMB should have by now"**

It's 2026. If your business still does these manually, you're burning money:

1️⃣ **Email triage** — AI reads, categorises, drafts replies. You just approve.
Saves: 5-8 hrs/week

2️⃣ **Lead qualification** — Chatbot or form + AI scoring. Hot leads get called first.
Saves: 3-5 hrs/week

3️⃣ **Invoice processing** — Scan → extract → match → book. No human needed for 90% of invoices.
Saves: 4-6 hrs/week

4️⃣ **Meeting notes + action items** — AI joins calls, writes summary, assigns tasks.
Saves: 2-3 hrs/week

5️⃣ **Client reporting** — Pull data, generate report, send. Automatic.
Saves: 3-5 hrs/week

Total potential: **17-27 hours/week** back to your team.

That's a half-time employee. Except it costs €200-500/month, not €2,000+.

### Wed Feb 25 — 📊 POLL
**LinkedIn Poll Post**

If you could automate ONE thing in your business tomorrow, what would it be?

🔵 Email & inbox management
🟢 Client/lead follow-up
🟡 Invoicing & admin
🔴 Reporting & analytics

I'm asking because every SMB owner I talk to thinks they know their biggest time sink — and they're usually wrong.

The real bottleneck is almost always something you've normalized.

"Oh, that only takes 20 minutes." Yeah — 20 minutes, 15 times a day.

Vote and I'll share what the data says next week 👇

### Fri Feb 27 — 🧑 Personal Story
**"The biggest mistake I made with my first AI client"**

I'll be honest — my first client engagement was a mess.

They wanted "AI for everything." I said yes to everything.

Email automation. Customer service bot. Inventory forecasting. Document processing. ALL AT ONCE.

Result? Nothing worked well. Everything was 70% done. The client was confused and frustrated.

The lesson that changed everything:

**Start with ONE automation. Make it bulletproof. Show the ROI. Then expand.**

Now my process is simple:
1. 15-minute call → identify the #1 time drain
2. Build ONE automation in 1-2 weeks
3. Measure the time saved
4. Client sees results → trusts the process → we expand

The irony? I now deliver MORE automations per client than before — because trust compounds faster than features.

What's a lesson that completely changed how you work? 👇

### Mon Mar 2 — 📊 Case Study
**"A real estate agency went from 3 hours to 20 minutes on listings"**

Writing property listings is one of those tasks that feels creative — but is actually 80% template.

A real estate agency I worked with was spending 2-3 hours per listing:
- Visit property → take notes → write description → translate to English → format → publish

We built an AI system that:
🔹 Takes the agent's bullet points + photos
🔹 Generates listing in Dutch AND English
🔹 Matches the agency's brand voice
🔹 Formats for Funda, their website, and social media
🔹 Agent reviews and publishes in minutes

Time per listing: from 3 hours → 20 minutes.
They list 8-10 properties per week.
That's **20+ hours saved weekly.**

The agent told me: "I finally have time to actually SELL instead of write."

That's the point. AI handles the repeatable work. Humans do the human work.

### Wed Mar 4 — 💡 Thought Leadership
**"Why 'just use ChatGPT' is terrible business advice"**

Every week I hear it: "Just get ChatGPT, it'll solve everything."

No. It won't. Here's why:

ChatGPT is a tool. Your business needs a SYSTEM.

The difference:

**Tool:** You type a prompt → you get an answer → you copy-paste it somewhere.
**System:** Data flows in → AI processes it → output goes where it needs to go → automatically.

A tool saves you minutes. A system saves you hours.

Example:
- **Tool:** Paste a CV into ChatGPT and ask it to summarise → 5 min saved
- **System:** CV arrives via email → AI reads it → scores it → updates your ATS → notifies the right recruiter → 3 hours saved

Same AI. Completely different results.

The businesses winning with AI aren't the ones using the fanciest models. They're the ones who built the plumbing.

Stop prompting. Start automating.

### Fri Mar 6 — 💡 Thought Leadership
**"The Netherlands is quietly becoming Europe's AI SMB hub"**

Some numbers that should excite every Dutch business owner:

📊 49% of Dutch businesses projected to use AI (well above EU average)
📊 23% year-over-year growth in AI adoption
📊 Dutch SMBs are more digitally mature than almost any EU country

But here's the thing nobody says:

Adoption ≠ Results.

Most Dutch SMBs have "adopted" AI the way I've "adopted" a gym membership. It exists. I don't use it.

The opportunity is massive for businesses that go beyond adoption to IMPLEMENTATION:
→ While your competitor "has ChatGPT," you have automated workflows
→ While they're prompting, you're scaling
→ While they're experimenting, you're saving 15 hours/week

The Netherlands has the digital infrastructure, the talent, and the business culture to lead Europe in practical AI.

The question is: will YOUR business be part of that?

What's your experience with AI adoption in your industry? 👇

### Mon Mar 9 — 📊 Case Study
**"An e-commerce company cut customer service costs by 60%"**

This one still surprises people.

An e-commerce SMB (team of 12) was spending €4,000/month on customer service — mostly answering the same 15 questions:

"Where's my order?"
"Can I return this?"
"Do you have it in blue?"

We built an AI customer service system:
🔹 Answers 85% of inquiries automatically (in Dutch AND English)
🔹 Pulls real-time order status from their system
🔹 Handles returns initiation end-to-end
🔹 Escalates complex issues to humans with full context

Results after 30 days:
✅ Customer service costs: €4,000 → €1,600/month
✅ Response time: 4 hours → 2 minutes (for automated queries)
✅ Customer satisfaction: UP 15% (faster responses = happier customers)
✅ Team now handles only complex, high-value interactions

The kicker? Setup took 2 weeks. Paid for itself in the first month.

This isn't futuristic tech. This is available right now, for businesses your size.

What repetitive customer questions does your team answer every day? 👇

### Wed Mar 11 — 💡 Thought Leadership
**"The real cost of 'we'll look into AI later'"**

I ran the numbers on a typical 20-person Dutch SMB:

Average time spent on automatable tasks: 15 hours/person/week
Average hourly cost (salary + overhead): €35/hour

That's €10,500 per week in automatable work.
€546,000 per year.

Even if you only automate 30% of that, you're saving €163,800/year.

Now compare:
💰 Cost of AI automation implementation: €5,000-15,000
💰 Monthly running costs: €500-1,000
💰 Annual total: €11,000-27,000

**ROI: 6x to 15x in year one.**

Every month you "look into it later," you're paying the procrastination tax.

I'm not saying this to sell you something. I'm saying this because the math is undeniable and the gap between early adopters and everyone else is widening fast.

The best time to start was last year. The second best time is this quarter.

Does this match what you're seeing in your business? 👇

### Fri Mar 13 — 🧑 Personal Story
**"What building AI systems taught me about being human"**

Strange thing happens when you automate work for a living:

You start to see how much of "work" was never really work.

It was copying data from one place to another.
It was writing the same email for the 100th time.
It was updating spreadsheets that nobody reads.

When I remove those tasks from a team, something shifts.

People start THINKING again.
They have time for the creative, strategic, human stuff.
They leave work on time.
They like their jobs more.

One client told me: "I forgot I was actually good at this job. I was so buried in admin I forgot why I started."

That hit me.

AI isn't about replacing humans. It's about letting humans be human.

The companies that understand this will attract the best talent.
The ones that don't will lose them to companies that do.

What part of your job do you wish you never had to do again? 👇

### Mon Mar 16 — 📊 Case Study
**"From manual invoicing to zero-touch: an accounting firm's story"**

An accounting firm (8 employees) processed 200+ invoices per week.

Their process was: receive → open → manually enter into system → cross-check → file.

Average time: 7-8 minutes per invoice. That's **25+ hours/week** on data entry alone.

We built an automated pipeline:
🔹 Invoice arrives (email/upload) → AI extracts all fields
🔹 Auto-matches to existing clients and GL codes
🔹 Flags anomalies for human review (only ~10%)
🔹 Books the rest automatically

Results:
✅ Processing time: 25 hrs/week → 3 hrs/week (review only)
✅ Error rate: DOWN 40% (AI is more consistent than tired humans)
✅ Staff reassigned to advisory work (higher value, happier team)

The firm owner said: "We should have done this two years ago."

Everyone says that. No one says "we started too early."

### Wed Mar 18 — 🎯 CTA / Offer
**"Free AI Opportunity Scan for Dutch SMBs"**

I've worked with enough SMBs to know:

Most business owners KNOW they should be using AI.
Most don't know WHERE to start.

So I'm offering something simple:

🔍 **Free 30-minute AI Opportunity Scan**

Here's what you get:
→ We look at your top 3 most time-consuming workflows
→ I identify which ones are automatable (and which aren't)
→ You get a concrete estimate: hours saved, costs, timeline
→ No pitch. No obligation. Just clarity.

Why free? Because 80% of the time, the scan leads to an obvious quick win. And when it does, we both know what to do next.

**This is for you if:**
✅ You run a Dutch SMB (5-50 employees)
✅ Your team wastes hours on repetitive tasks
✅ You've been "meaning to look into AI" but haven't started
✅ You want honest advice, not a sales pitch

**Not for you if:**
❌ You're looking for a ChatGPT tutorial
❌ You want AI to replace your entire team
❌ You're not willing to change any processes

DM me "SCAN" or comment below and I'll reach out.

Spots are limited — I do these personally, so I can only take 10 this month.

### Fri Mar 20 — 💡 Thought Leadership
**"3 signs your competitor is already using AI (and you can't tell)"**

Your competitor probably isn't posting about their AI strategy on LinkedIn.

But here are 3 signs they're already ahead:

**1. They respond faster than humanly possible**
If their customer service replies in 90 seconds at 11pm on a Sunday — that's AI. And their customers are getting used to it. Yours still wait until Monday.

**2. Their content output doubled overnight**
Suddenly they're posting daily. Listings are perfectly written. Newsletters go out weekly. One person didn't become a content machine. AI did.

**3. They're hiring FEWER people but growing FASTER**
This is the big one. When a 15-person company outperforms a 30-person company, it's not luck. It's leverage.

The uncomfortable truth: AI adoption is invisible from the outside. You won't see a press release. You'll just slowly notice that some competitors seem... faster. Sharper. More present.

By the time it's obvious, you're 2 years behind.

Is this paranoia? No. It's pattern recognition.

Which of these signs have you noticed in your industry? 👇

### Mon Mar 23 — 📊 Case Study
**"Marketing agency saves 8 hours/week on client reporting"**

A marketing agency (6 people) spent every Friday afternoon the same way:

Log into Google Analytics. Screenshot. Log into Meta Ads. Screenshot. Log into Mailchimp. Screenshot. Open PowerPoint. Paste. Format. Send.

For EACH of their 12 clients. Every. Single. Week.

We automated the entire flow:
🔹 AI pulls data from all platforms automatically
🔹 Generates branded PDF report per client
🔹 Includes AI-written insights ("Your Instagram reach dropped 12% — here's likely why")
🔹 Sends on schedule. No human involvement.

Results:
✅ 8 hours/week freed up (entire Friday afternoon back)
✅ Reports are MORE detailed than before (AI catches things humans skip)
✅ Clients love the consistent insights
✅ Agency took on 3 new clients without hiring

The founder told me: "Friday afternoons used to be our worst day. Now it's when we do our best creative work."

### Wed Mar 25 — 💡 Thought Leadership
**"The AI maturity scale: where does your business sit?"**

After working with dozens of SMBs, I see 5 clear stages:

**Level 0: Unaware**
"AI? That's for big companies."
→ Risk: already falling behind

**Level 1: Curious**
"We should probably look into this."
→ Action: read, research, talk to people in your industry

**Level 2: Experimenting**
"We use ChatGPT sometimes."
→ Action: identify your #1 time drain and build a real automation

**Level 3: Implementing**
"We have 2-3 AI workflows running."
→ Action: measure ROI, document processes, expand to more areas

**Level 4: Integrated**
"AI is part of how we operate."
→ Action: optimize, connect systems, build competitive moat

**Level 5: AI-Native**
"We couldn't run our business without AI."
→ Action: you're the one others should be studying

Most Dutch SMBs are at Level 1-2.
The winners in 2027 will be at Level 3-4.
The leaders will be at Level 5.
