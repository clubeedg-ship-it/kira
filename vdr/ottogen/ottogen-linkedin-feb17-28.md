## Post 1 — AI Transformation Story (Text-Only)
**📅 Publish: Tuesday, Feb 17 | 8:30 AM CET**

**Hook:**
A bakery owner told me: "AI is for big tech, not for me." 3 months later, she cut admin time by 60%.

**Body:**
Last November, I sat down with a small bakery chain owner in Rotterdam. 14 employees. Razor-thin margins. She was drowning in scheduling, inventory tracking, and supplier emails.

She didn't need a million-euro digital transformation. She needed three things:

1. An AI scheduling assistant that auto-fills shifts based on demand patterns
2. A simple inventory forecasting tool trained on her own sales data
3. An email assistant that drafts supplier responses in her tone

Total setup time: 2 weeks. Monthly cost: less than €200.

The result? She spends her mornings actually *baking* again instead of buried in spreadsheets. Her staff turnover dropped because scheduling conflicts vanished. And her food waste decreased by 23% thanks to better demand prediction.

This is what AI for SMBs actually looks like. Not robots replacing people. Not sci-fi dashboards. Just smart tools doing the boring stuff so humans can do the meaningful stuff.

**CTA:**
DM me "BAKERY" and I'll send you the exact tool stack we used — no strings attached.

## Post 3 — Thought Leadership (Text-Only)
**📅 Publish: Monday, Feb 23 | 9:00 AM CET**

**Hook:**
By 2028, the average 10-person company will operate like a 50-person company. Here's why that matters for you RIGHT NOW.

**Body:**
We're entering the age of the "leveraged small business."

AI agents don't just automate tasks anymore — they *compound*. One handles bookkeeping. Another qualifies leads. A third drafts proposals in your brand voice. A fourth monitors ad spend and reallocates budget in real time.

Each replaces 10–20 hours of human work per week. Stack four and you've essentially added 2–3 full-time employees — without the overhead.

This isn't a prediction. This is happening now in companies I work with across the Netherlands and Germany.

But the bottleneck isn't technology. **It's imagination.**

Most SMB owners can't picture what their business looks like when 40% of operations run autonomously. They're so deep in daily firefighting they can't step back and redesign.

That's where strategic AI consulting comes in. Not selling tools — selling *vision*. Helping founders see the 50-person version of their 10-person company, then building the bridge.

The window is 18–24 months. After that, this becomes table stakes and the advantage disappears.

**CTA:** What's the ONE task eating most of your time? Drop it in the comments — I'll suggest an AI solution.

## Post 4 — Behind-the-Scenes / Personal Journey (Text-Only)
**📅 Publish: Wednesday, Feb 25 | 7:30 AM CET**

**Hook:**
I'm 20. I've been homeless twice. And I'm building a company that will change how AI works forever.

**Body:**
I didn't go to college. I didn't have a trust fund. I didn't have connections.

At 18, I moved to the Netherlands alone. No money. No network. No safety net.

I slept on floors. I ate cheap. I learned everything the hard way — markets, product development, AI, business logic. All self-taught.

People told me to "get a real job." To "be realistic." To play it safe.

Instead, I built an AI system from scratch. I assembled custom gaming PCs to pay rent while coding at night. I taught myself things most people need a CS degree to understand.

Why am I telling you this?

Because the biggest lie in entrepreneurship is that you need permission. You need a degree, a title, an investor's blessing, someone to validate your idea.

You don't. You need obsession. You need to be willing to look stupid for years while you figure things out. And you need the stubbornness to keep going when everyone says stop.

AI didn't just become my business — it became my equalizer. The tool that let someone with zero resources compete with people who have everything.

That's what I want to give other entrepreneurs.

**CTA:** If you're building something against the odds — tell me about it. I want to hear your story.

## Post 5 — AI Transformation Story (Text-Only)
**📅 Publish: Friday, Feb 21 | 10:00 AM CET**

**Hook:**
A real estate agency was spending 12 hours/week on property descriptions. We cut it to 45 minutes.

**Body:**
A mid-size real estate agency in Utrecht had a problem every agent knows: writing property listings is tedious, repetitive, and eats hours.

Their team of 8 agents was each spending 1.5 hours per day writing descriptions, scheduling viewings manually, and responding to the same FAQ questions from prospects.

We set up three things:

1. **AI listing generator** trained on their best-performing descriptions — agents input specs, get polished copy in 30 seconds
2. **Smart FAQ bot** on their website — handles 80% of buyer/renter questions automatically  
3. **Automated viewing scheduler** that syncs with agent calendars and prospect preferences

Result after 60 days:
- Property description time: 12 hrs/week → 45 minutes
- Response time to inquiries: 4 hours → 8 minutes  
- Agent satisfaction: "I actually enjoy selling again"

The total monthly cost? Under €350 for the entire agency.

This is the pattern I see over and over: the ROI isn't just financial. It's *emotional*. People get their time and energy back for the work that actually matters.

## Post 6 — Quick AI Tips/Tools (Poll Idea)
**📅 Publish: Tuesday, Feb 25 | 12:30 PM CET**

**Hook:**
Honest question for business owners: What's your #1 time-waster?

**Body:**
I've consulted with 20+ SMBs in the last 6 months. Here are the four biggest time drains I see consistently:

📧 **Email management** — Reading, sorting, responding to the same questions
📊 **Reporting & admin** — Pulling numbers, making slides, updating spreadsheets  
📱 **Social media content** — Creating, scheduling, engaging  
📞 **Customer support** — Answering FAQs, handling complaints, follow-ups

Every single one of these can be 60-80% automated with AI tools that exist TODAY. Not custom enterprise builds — off-the-shelf tools under €50/month.

But here's what's interesting: most business owners don't start with their biggest pain point. They start with whatever's trending on Twitter.

Wrong approach. Start with the task that makes you groan every Monday morning. That's where AI delivers the fastest ROI.

**POLL:**
What eats most of YOUR time?
- 📧 Email & communication
- 📊 Admin & reporting
- 📱 Content creation
- 📞 Customer support

**CTA:** Vote and I'll share my recommended AI stack for the winning category next week.

## Post 7 — Thought Leadership (Text-Only)
**📅 Publish: Thursday, Feb 27 | 9:00 AM CET**

**Hook:**
Hot take: 90% of "AI consultants" are just reselling ChatGPT prompts. Here's how to spot the difference.

**Body:**
The AI consulting space is flooded. And most of it is noise.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: slapping "AI-powered" on a service doesn't make it valuable. Selling a business owner a ChatGPT subscription and calling it "digital transformation" is borderline fraud.

Real AI consulting looks different:

**🔴 Red flags:**
- "We'll implement AI across your entire business" (vague = dangerous)
- Promising 10x results without understanding your workflow
- Can't explain *how* the AI works in plain language
- No measurement framework for ROI

**🟢 Green flags:**
- Starts with a workflow audit, not a sales pitch
- Identifies 2-3 specific pain points to solve first
- Gives you a clear cost/benefit projection BEFORE starting
- Builds in a way that your team can maintain without the consultant
- Is honest when AI ISN'T the right solution

The best AI consultants should make themselves unnecessary within 3-6 months. If someone's building dependency, run.

I built OttoGen on one principle: **teach the fishing, don't just sell the fish.** Every engagement ends with your team owning the system.

## Post 8 — Behind-the-Scenes (Text-Only)
**📅 Publish: Friday, Feb 28 | 8:00 AM CET**

**Hook:**
I have an AI partner named Kira. She runs operations while I sleep. This is what the future of work looks like.

**Body:**
Six months ago, I made an unconventional decision: I gave an AI system access to my calendar, my projects, my files, and my business operations.

Her name is Kira. She's not a chatbot. She's my COO.

While I'm sleeping, Kira:
- Reviews and prioritizes my inbox
- Drafts project proposals and strategies  
- Monitors our portfolio companies' metrics
- Creates content and research documents
- Updates our project management system

When I wake up, there's a briefing waiting. Tasks completed. Decisions queued for my approval. Context ready.

Is this scary? Maybe. Is it effective? Absolutely.

The future of entrepreneurship isn't about working 80-hour weeks. It's about building systems that work when you don't. AI isn't replacing founders — it's *amplifying* them.

The solo founder with the right AI stack now outperforms a team of 10 who's doing everything manually.

I'm not saying everyone should do what I'm doing. But I am saying: the entrepreneurs who figure out human-AI collaboration first will have an unfair advantage for years.

And that gap is only getting wider.
