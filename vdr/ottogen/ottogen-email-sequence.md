## Email 1: Warm Intro (Day 1 after connection)

**Subject:** Nice to connect, {{firstName}} — quick thought on {{companyName}}

---

Hi {{firstName}},

Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn. I took a quick look at {{companyName}} and wanted to reach out properly.

I'm Otto — I build AI automations for Dutch SMBs, mostly in {{industry}}. Think chatbots that actually work, automated follow-ups, smart document handling. Practical stuff that saves hours, not sci-fi.

The businesses I work with typically have 5-50 people and share the same problem: too much manual work, not enough hours, and no idea where to start with AI.

I'm not going to pitch you in this email. But if you've ever thought *"there has to be a faster way to do this"* about any part of your workflow — I'd love to hear what "this" is.

Happy to chat whenever it suits you.

Best,
**Otto**

## Email 2: Value-Add Follow-Up (Day 4)

**Subject:** Quick AI insight for {{industry}} teams

---

Hi {{firstName}},

Came across something this week I thought you'd find useful.

I ran an analysis across 12 Dutch {{industry}} companies (all under 50 employees) and found that **the average team loses 11.5 hours/week** on tasks that AI can handle today — not next year, today.

The top three time drains:

1. **Responding to repetitive client questions** → solvable with a trained AI chatbot (2-3 hrs/week saved)
2. **Manual data entry and transfers between tools** → solvable with workflow automation (4-5 hrs/week saved)
3. **Writing and formatting routine documents** → solvable with AI content generation (3-4 hrs/week saved)

At an average loaded cost of €35/hr, that's roughly **€1,600/month walking out the door**.

No pitch here — just thought it was worth sharing. If any of those three hit close to home, happy to dig into what the fix would look like for {{companyName}} specifically.

Best,
**Otto**

## Email 3: Soft Close — Free Audit (Day 8)

**Subject:** Free 15-min AI audit for {{companyName}}?

---

Hi {{firstName}},

Last email from me (I keep it to three — nobody likes a cluttered inbox).

I'm offering a **free 15-minute AI audit** for Dutch SMBs this month. Here's what you'd walk away with:

- A clear picture of which tasks in your workflow are automatable *right now*
- A rough estimate of hours and euros you're leaving on the table
- A prioritised shortlist: what to automate first for the fastest ROI

No slides, no sales deck. Just a screen share where I walk through your setup and point out the low-hanging fruit. If there's nothing to automate, I'll tell you that too.

**Pick a slot:** [Calendly link]

Or just reply with a time that works and I'll send an invite.

Either way — good luck with everything at {{companyName}}.

Best,
**Otto**

## Sequence Rules

| Step | Timing | Action if no reply |
|---|---|---|
| Email 1 | Day 1 (24h after LinkedIn accept) | Wait 3 days |
| Email 2 | Day 4 | Wait 4 days |
| Email 3 | Day 8 | Stop. Add to nurture list. |

- **If they reply at any point** → break sequence, go conversational
- **If they book an audit** → send confirmation + audit prep questions (see audit template)
- **Never send Email 3 on a Friday** — Monday or Tuesday morning is ideal
