## PROBLEM SECTION

### Section Header
**THE PROBLEM**

### Copy

**You've heard the noise. You haven't seen the signal.**

Every week there's a new AI headline. Every month a new tool promising to "revolutionise" your business. Your LinkedIn feed is full of consultants who discovered ChatGPT last year and now sell "AI strategy."

Meanwhile, your team is still:
- Copy-pasting data between spreadsheets and your CRM
- Manually sorting through 200 emails before lunch
- Writing the same proposal template for the 400th time
- Losing leads because follow-ups slip through the cracks
- Making decisions on gut feel when the data is right there

**The gap isn't awareness. It's implementation.**

You know AI matters. You just don't know where to start — or who to trust. The big consultancies want €50K for a roadmap. The freelancers disappear after setup. The tools promise "no-code" but require an engineering degree.

You need someone who's done this. Not theorised about it. Done it.

## SOLUTION SECTION

### Section Header
**THE OTTOGEN APPROACH**

### Copy

**We don't sell AI. We install it.**

OttoGen takes your existing business processes — the ones your team runs every day — and rebuilds them with AI at the core. Not as a layer on top. Not as a chatbot in the corner. As infrastructure.

**How it works:**

**1. Diagnose →** We map your workflows, find the bottlenecks, and identify where AI creates immediate ROI. Not where it sounds cool — where it saves money.

**2. Build → ** We deploy custom automations integrated with your existing tools. HubSpot, Exact, Salesforce, Google Workspace — whatever you use. Running within weeks.

**3. Train → ** Your team learns to use and extend the systems. We don't create dependency. We create capability.

**4. Optimise → ** Post-launch support ensures everything runs smoothly. We measure results and fine-tune based on real data.

**The result?** Businesses that run faster, make fewer errors, and free their people to do work that actually matters.

## ABOUT SECTION

### Section Header
**WHO BUILDS THIS**

### Copy

**Otto is 20. He runs six companies. This isn't a flex — it's context.**

While established consultants were learning what a "prompt" was, Otto was already deploying AI systems across:

- **Chimera** — Privacy-preserving AI infrastructure
- **oopuo** — AI-powered operations
- **Sentinagro** — Agricultural drone automation
- **ZenithCred** — Gamified corporate wellness
- **IAM** — Intelligent ambient environments
- **CuttingEdge** — Interior design with AI tooling

Every OttoGen service is built on systems Otto uses daily across real companies. This isn't theory extracted from a textbook. It's practice extracted from the trenches.

**Why a 20-year-old?**

Because the AI landscape moves weekly. The people who understand it best aren't the ones who "adapted" — they're the ones who grew up inside it. Otto doesn't translate AI into business language. He thinks in both natively.

**Dutch directness included.** No inflated timelines. No vague deliverables. You'll know exactly what you're getting, when, and what it costs.

## OBJECTION HANDLING SECTION

### Section Header
**FAIR QUESTIONS**

**"We're too small for AI."**
If you have email, spreadsheets, and customers — you're big enough. Our Starter package is designed for teams of 5+.

**"We tried AI tools before. They didn't stick."**
Tools without integration fail. We don't give you tools — we redesign your workflows with AI built in. And we train your team so it sticks.

**"How is a 20-year-old qualified?"**
By running six companies on these exact systems. Otto doesn't advise from the sideline — he builds from the pitch. Check the portfolio. Judge the work.

**"What's the ROI?"**
Our SIGNAL package typically pays for itself within 30 days through time savings alone. AMPLIFY clients see 3–5x returns within 6 months. OVERDRIVE includes an ROI guarantee.

**"We're not technical."**
Good. Neither are most of our clients. We handle the technical. You handle the business. Your team gets trained on the systems in plain language.
