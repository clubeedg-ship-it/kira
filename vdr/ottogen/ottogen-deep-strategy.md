# OttoGen — Deep Strategy
*Kira | Feb 8, 2026*

---

## The First €1K Plan

### Dutch AI Adoption Context (Verified Feb 2026)
- **49% of Dutch businesses** projected to use AI by 2025 (23% YoY growth, above EU average) — *Source: FirstAIMovers.com, Dec 2025*
- **95% adoption but only 5% see real ROI** — massive implementation gap = OttoGen's opportunity — *Source: DEV.to / Dutch SME research, Jan 2026*
- Sweet spot: businesses that *want* AI but lack skills to extract value from it

### The 20 SMBs to DM Monday

**Selection criteria:** 
- Netherlands-based, 5-50 employees
- Service businesses (higher margin, more admin waste to automate)
- Active on LinkedIn or Instagram (signal of digital awareness)
- No dedicated IT department (= need external AI help)

**Target industries (highest AI ROI for SMBs):**
1. **Real estate agencies** (5 companies) — Lead qualification, listing descriptions, email follow-up
2. **Marketing/design agencies** (5) — Content generation, client reporting, workflow automation
3. **Accounting firms** (3) — Document processing, client communication, tax prep automation
4. **E-commerce businesses** (3) — Customer service bots, inventory, product descriptions
5. **Recruitment agencies** (2) — CV screening, outreach, candidate matching
6. **Legal practices** (2) — Document review, client intake, contract generation

### The DM Script (LinkedIn)

**Version 1 — Direct:**
> Hey [Name], ik zag dat [company] [specific thing]. Ik help MKB-bedrijven met AI-automatisering — dingen als e-mail triage, klantenservice bots, en document processing. Gemiddeld bespaar ik bedrijven 10-15 uur per week. Zou je 15 min willen bellen om te kijken of er quick wins zijn voor jullie?

**Version 2 — Value-first:**
> Hey [Name], ik heb even naar [company website] gekeken en zie 3 plekken waar AI jullie makkelijk 10+ uur/week kan besparen. [Specific observation]. Mag ik een korte analyse sturen? Geen kosten, geen verplichtingen.

### Conversion Funnel (realistic)
- 20 DMs → 5-8 replies (25-40%) → 3-4 calls (15-20%) → 1-2 clients (5-10%)
- Need 40-60 DMs to reliably get 3-5 paying clients in first month
- **Scale to 10 DMs/day = 50/week = 200/month**

## Service Delivery: One-Person Model

### How Otto Delivers as One Person + Kira

**Tier 1 (SIGNAL — €500-1,000):**
- Assessment: 2-hour call + Kira analysis = 3-4 hours total
- Quick wins: Kira builds automations, Otto presents = 4-6 hours
- Roadmap: Kira drafts, Otto reviews = 2 hours
- **Total: ~10-12 hours per client**
- **Effective rate: €50-100/hour**

**Tier 2 (AMPLIFY — €2,500-5,000):**
- Custom automation: Kira builds 80%, Otto customizes 20% = 15-20 hours
- Training: Otto delivers 2-hour session = 2 hours
- **Total: ~20-25 hours per client**
- **Effective rate: €100-200/hour**

### Capacity at Various Loads
| Clients/month | Hours | Revenue | Feasible? |
|---------------|-------|---------|-----------|
| 2 Tier 1 | 20-24h | €1,000-2,000 | ✅ Easy |
| 4 Tier 1 | 40-48h | €2,000-4,000 | ✅ Tight but doable |
| 2 Tier 1 + 1 Tier 2 | 40-50h | €3,500-7,000 | ✅ Full capacity |
| 3 Tier 1 + 1 Tier 2 | 50-60h | €4,000-8,000 | ⚠️ Overloaded |

**Sweet spot: 3-4 engagements/month = €3-6K revenue at ~40 hours**

## Scaling: When to Hire

### Trigger Points
1. **Hire contractor #1 when:** Monthly revenue > €5K for 2+ months, waitlist forming
2. **Hire contractor #2 when:** Monthly revenue > €10K, delivery quality dropping
3. **Consider employee when:** Monthly revenue > €15K for 3+ months

### Margins to Maintain
- **Solo:** 85-90% gross margin (only tool costs)
- **With contractors:** Target 50-60% gross margin (pay €30-50/hr, charge €100-200/hr effective)
- **With employees:** Target 40-50% gross margin
- **Never go below 40%** — that's the floor for a services business

### Contractor Profile
- Freelance AI/automation specialist
- Pay: €35-50/hour
- Find on: Fiverr, Upwork, Dutch freelance platforms (Freelance.nl, Headfirst)
- Kira manages the work, contractor executes, Otto does client-facing
