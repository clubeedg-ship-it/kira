## CHANNEL 1: LINKEDIN (Primary — 50% of pipeline)

### Week 0: Profile Optimisation (Day 1)

**Headline:**
`I help European SMBs implement AI that actually works | Running 6 AI-powered companies | Founder @ OttoGen`

**About section (first 3 lines visible):**
> Most AI consultants discovered ChatGPT last year. I've been building AI systems across 6 companies for years. Now I help SMBs do the same — fixed price, running systems in weeks. → ottogen.io

**Featured section:**
- OttoGen landing page link
- 1 case study / portfolio piece
- "Free AI Audit" booking link

### Content Strategy: Post Daily (Days 1–30)

**Week 1 — Establish authority:**
- Day 1: "I'm 20 and run 6 companies on AI. Here's what I learned about what actually works for small businesses." (Thread/carousel)
- Day 2: "The 5 AI automations every SMB should have running by March 2026" (list post)
- Day 3: Share a specific before/after: "This workflow took 3 hours. Now it takes 12 minutes. Here's what we changed."
- Day 4: Hot take: "90% of AI consultants are selling you ChatGPT prompts for €200/hr. Here's how to spot the difference."
- Day 5: Value post: "I'll audit your business for AI opportunities for free. DM me 'AUDIT' or comment below. First 10 this week."

**Weeks 2–4 — Rotate between:**
- Results/proof posts (even from own companies)
- "AI tip of the day" practical content
- Contrarian takes on AI hype
- Free audit CTAs (every 3rd post)
- Behind-the-scenes of building OttoGen

### Outbound DM Strategy (20 per day)

**Target profiles:**
- Dutch/Belgian/German SMB owners (CEO, Managing Director, Eigenaar)
- 10–200 employees

- Active on LinkedIn (posted in last 30 days)

**Search strings:**
- `"directeur" OR "eigenaar" OR "managing director" location:Netherlands`
- `"CEO" "MKB" OR "SME" location:Netherlands OR location:Belgium`
- Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator if budget allows (€80/month — worth it)

## DUTCH MARKET SPECIFICS

- **Language:** DM and email in Dutch for local SMBs. Switch to English for international / tech companies. Landing page: English primary, Dutch version as Phase 2.
- **Culture:** Dutch business owners value directness and hate fluff. Get to the point. State the price upfront. Don't oversell.
- **Payment:** Dutch SMBs prefer bank transfer (overboeking) or iDEAL. Credit cards less common. Offer both.
- **Legal:** Use standard Dutch freelance/consultancy terms (algemene voorwaarden). Consider a simple opdrachtbevestiging over complex contracts for SIGNAL tier.
- **Geography:** Focus on Randstad (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht) first — highest density of SMBs. Expand to Eindhoven (tech), Groningen, Brabant.
- **Seasonality:** February–March is good timing — businesses have set 2026 budgets and are looking to invest in efficiency.
- **KvK registration:** Ensure OttoGen is registered with proper SBI codes for consultancy/IT services.
