## Phase 1 · WELCOME & INTRO (5 min)

### Set the Stage

> *"Hey everyone! Welcome, thanks for being here. I'm Otto, founder of OttoGen. I'm 20 years old and I've spent the last [X] years deep in the AI trenches — not the sci-fi stuff, the real stuff that actually saves businesses time and money every single week."*
>
> *"Today is NOT a sales pitch. This is a workshop. You're going to leave here understanding exactly what AI can do for YOUR business — and I'll show you some things live that will blow your mind a little. Sound good?"*

### Quick Round of Intros

> *"Before we dive in, let's go quick around the room — just your name and what your business does. 15 seconds each. Who wants to go first?"*

**While they intro:** Note down each person's name + business type. Star anyone who sounds enthusiastic. You'll use their examples throughout.

> *"Awesome group. [Coach's name] has great taste. Let's get into it."*

---

## Phase 2 · THE AI LANDSCAPE (5 min)

### Make AI Real, Not Scary

> *"So — AI. Everyone's heard the buzzword. Let me strip away the hype and show you what it actually does for businesses like yours RIGHT NOW. Not in five years. Today."*

### The Five Things AI Does for Small Businesses

Use a casual, conversational delivery. Point at each one:

> *"Number one — **it writes for you.** Social media posts, emails, proposals, product descriptions. In seconds, not hours.*
>
> *Number two — **it answers for you.** Customer questions at 3am? A chatbot that actually sounds human. No more missed leads overnight.*
>
> *Number three — **it organizes for you.** Sorting emails, categorizing expenses, summarizing hour-long meetings into bullet points.*
>
> *Number four — **it connects your tools.** Your CRM talks to your email talks to your calendar. No more copy-pasting between five apps.*
>
> *Number five — **it predicts for you.** Which leads are likely to buy, when you'll run low on stock, which clients are about to churn."*

### Ground It

> *"The businesses I work with? They're not tech companies. They're plumbers, coaches, shop owners, agencies. Real businesses. And they're saving 10-20 hours a week on stuff they used to do by hand."*

**Pause. Let that land.**

> *"Let me show you what I mean."*

## Phase 3 · LIVE DEMO — "AI IN ACTION" (10 min)

### The Jaw-Drop Moment

This is where you win the room. Show 2-3 demos, chosen based on the group's industries.

### Demo Menu (pick 2-3 relevant to your audience)

| Industry Cluster | Demo | The "Wow" Factor |
|---|---|---|
| **Services / Agency** | Paste a client brief into ChatGPT → get a full proposal draft in 30 sec | "That would take your team 2 hours" |
| **Services / Agency** | Show an automation: new lead form → auto-email + CRM entry + team notification | "Runs while you sleep" |
| **Retail / E-commerce** | Feed product photos → AI generates 5 product descriptions + SEO tags | "One afternoon's work, done in 60 seconds" |
| **Retail / E-commerce** | AI categorizing customer support emails by urgency (live sort) | "Your best employee doesn't get sick" |
| **Consulting / Coaching** | Upload a call recording → AI produces blog post + email + social post | "One call, four pieces of content" |
| **Consulting / Coaching** | AI-powered lead scoring from form submissions | "Stop guessing who's ready to buy" |
| **Trades / Local** | AI generating a quote from a photo of the job site | "Send estimates from the truck" |
| **Trades / Local** | Auto-scheduling + confirmation SMS + review request flow | "Full client lifecycle, zero admin" |

### How to Demo

1. **Name someone in the room:** *"[Name], you said you run a [business]. Watch this."*
2. **Use their actual business info.** Type their company name into the prompt. Make it personal.
3. **Do it live.** No slides. No recordings. Real-time. Let them watch it happen.
4. **Show the clock:** *"That took 22 seconds. How long does your team spend on this?"*
5. **Ask the group:** *"Who else does something like this every week?"* (Hands up = engagement)

> *"And I want to be clear — this is the SIMPLE stuff. This is day one. Imagine what happens after a month of optimization."*

---

## Phase 4 · WORKSHOP: FIND YOUR AI WINS (10 min)

### The Interactive Aha Moment

> *"Alright, your turn. I want everyone to grab a pen — or just open your notes app — and write down your THREE most time-consuming tasks every week. The stuff that eats your hours. The stuff you dread on Monday morning."*
>
> *"Take 60 seconds. Be specific. Not 'admin' — what admin? 'Writing follow-up emails to leads' is specific. Go."*

**Give them 60-90 seconds. Stay quiet. Let them think.**

### Harvest & Demo

> *"Okay — who wants to share one? [Name], what's your biggest time killer?"*

Pick 2-3 tasks from the group. For each one:

1. **Validate:** *"Yeah, that's super common. I see this with every [industry] business."*
2. **Solve it live:** Show how AI handles it — even if it's just a ChatGPT prompt on the spot
3. **Quantify:** *"If that takes you [X] hours per week, that's [X×4] hours a month. At €[rate]/hour, you're spending €[total]/month on something AI could do in minutes."*

### Group Engagement Prompt

> *"Raise your hand if at least ONE of your three tasks could be handled by what I just showed you."*

**(Most hands go up — this is the moment.)**

> *"That's what I thought. Now imagine that across ALL three tasks. That's the kind of transformation I build for businesses."*

---

## Phase 5 · THE OFFER (5 min)

### Natural Transition — Not a Pitch

> *"So here's the thing — everything I showed you today, you could technically figure out on your own. YouTube tutorials, trial and error, ChatGPT prompts. It'd take you... months. And honestly, most people start and never finish."*
>
> *"What I do is skip all that. I come into your business, find the wins, build the automations, and hand them to you working. Here's how that looks:"*

### Three Tiers

| Package | What You Get | Investment |
|---|---|---|
| **🔍 AI Audit** | 2-hour deep dive into your business. I find every automation opportunity, build 2-3 quick wins on the spot, and give you a full roadmap. | **€500 flat** |
| **🤝 AI Partner** | Monthly retainer — I'm your AI guy. New automations every month, optimization, support, monthly strategy call. | **€1,500–2,500/mo** |
| **🏗️ Custom Build** | You have a specific big problem? I scope it, build it, test it, hand it over. Full project. | **€2,500–5,000** |

### Present with Confidence

> *"Most people start with the Audit. €500, two hours, and you walk away with actual working automations plus a roadmap for everything else. If it saves you even 5 hours a month — and it will save way more than that — it pays for itself immediately."*

### Workshop Attendee Bonus

> *"Because you showed up today and actually engaged with this — I want to offer everyone here a **free 15-minute follow-up call** with me. One-on-one. We can look at YOUR specific business, YOUR tasks, and I'll tell you exactly what I'd do. No charge, no commitment. Just value."*
>
> *"If you want that, send me a message after this or grab me at the end. I'll send you a calendar link."*

**Do NOT hard-close the group.** The bonus call is your conversion tool — that's where you close 1-on-1.

---

## Phase 6 · Q&A (5-10 min)

### Open It Up

> *"Alright — let's open it up. What questions do you have? About AI, about your business, about anything I showed today. No dumb questions, seriously."*

### Seed Questions (if the room is quiet)

- *"A question I get a lot is: 'What if my business is too small for this?' Short answer: the smaller you are, the more it matters. You don't have a team of 20 to throw at admin."*
- *"Another one: 'Is my data safe?' Great question. Here's how that works..."*
- *"People also ask: 'What if AI makes mistakes?' It does. That's why you have guardrails — I'll show you how."*

### Handle Each Question Like a Mini-Demo

If someone asks about their specific situation, solve it on the spot if you can. Every answer is a mini-showcase of your expertise.

---

## Objection Handling (Group Context)

In a group setting, objections usually come during Q&A or in the follow-up call. Adapt these to feel conversational, not defensive.

### "I'm not tech-savvy enough for this"

> *"That's actually the whole point. I don't teach you to code. I build it, I hand it to you working, and I make it so simple your least tech-savvy team member can use it. If you can use WhatsApp, you can use what I build."*

### "My business is too small / it's just me"

> *"If anything, that's the BEST use case. You don't have a team to delegate to. AI becomes your team. I have solo operators saving 15 hours a week — that's basically a part-time employee you don't have to pay."*

### "AI is going to replace people / I'm scared of it"

> *"I totally understand that feeling. But here's the reality — AI doesn't replace good people, it removes the boring stuff from their plate. Your best employee spends 30% of their time on admin. What if they spent that 30% on the work that actually grows your business?"*

### "€500 is a lot for a small business"

> *"I hear you. Let me put it differently — you said [task] takes you [X] hours a week. Even at €25/hour for your time, that's €[amount] per month. The audit is €500 once, and the savings repeat every month forever. It's not an expense, it's the last expense you need for that problem."*

### "Can't I just use ChatGPT myself?"

> *"You absolutely can — and you should! For simple stuff, ChatGPT is amazing. What I do is the stuff you can't Google: connecting your systems, building automations that run without you, creating workflows that save you hours every week automatically. ChatGPT is the tool. I'm the mechanic."*

## 🔍 Reading the Room — Spotting Your Hottest Leads

During the workshop, track these signals to identify who's most likely to convert:

### High-Interest Signals (🔥)

| Signal | What It Looks Like | What to Do |
|---|---|---|
| **Nodding + note-taking** | They're writing things down, nodding along | Use their name more, direct examples at them |
| **Specific questions** | "Could this work for [their specific task]?" | Answer thoroughly — this is buying behavior |
| **Sharing pain openly** | "We spend SO much time on invoicing" | Validate and demo a solution on the spot |
| **Leaning forward / camera on** | Physical engagement, eye contact | They're mentally in — make eye contact back |
| **Asking about pricing details** | "What does the monthly retainer include?" | They're already past "if" and into "how" |
| **Volunteering tasks in workshop** | First to share, eager to participate | Your most likely first close |

### Low-Interest Signals (❄️)

| Signal | What It Looks Like | Don't |
|---|---|---|
| **Camera off, silent** | No engagement, no questions | Don't call them out. Let them be. |
| **Skeptical pushback** | "AI can't do what we do" | Don't argue. Acknowledge and move on. |
| **Checking phone / distracted** | Clearly not present | Focus energy on the engaged people |

### Post-Workshop Priority

1. **🔥 Hot leads** — Message within 1 hour. Book the free follow-up call immediately.
2. **🟡 Warm leads** — Send a summary + "great meeting you" within 24 hours.
3. **❄️ Cold leads** — Add to email list. They might warm up later.

---

## Lead Qualification (Group Adaptation)

In a group workshop, you can't interrogate. Instead, listen for these signals naturally:

| What You Need to Know | How to Get It in a Group |
|---|---|
| **Decision-maker?** | Note who introduces themselves as "owner" or "founder" vs "I work at..." |
| **Budget comfort?** | Listen for: "We've tried tools before" or "We invested in [software]" = budget exists |
| **Urgency?** | Who shares the most painful tasks? Who says "we NEED to fix this"? |
| **Team size / scope** | Picked up during intros and task exercise |
| **Timeline** | Asked in the follow-up call, not the workshop |

Save the deep qualification for the free 15-min follow-up call. That's your real sales conversation.

---

## Post-Workshop Lead Scoring

Rate each attendee 1-5 immediately after. Use your notes from "Reading the Room."

| Criteria | 1 (Cold) | 3 (Warm) | 5 (Hot) |

| **Pain Level** | No clear pain expressed | Mentioned annoyances | Specific, quantified pain ("we spend 15hrs/week on...") |

| **Buying Signals** | None | "Interesting" / took notes | Asked about pricing, timeline, next steps |
| **Follow-Up Response** | Didn't respond to message | Replied but vague | Booked the follow-up call quickly |

- **After:** Update the coach on results. Share any wins publicly (with permission)
- **Revenue share:** If applicable, have this agreed before the workshop
