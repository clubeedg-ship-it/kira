# OttoGen — Free 15-Minute AI Audit

## How to Use This

Run through the 10 questions in conversation (not as a form). Takes ~10 minutes. Spend the last 5 minutes on the scorecard and recommendation. The audit should feel like a helpful chat, not an interrogation.

## The 10 Questions

### Block 1: The Business (2 min)

**Q1. What does your team do day-to-day, in plain terms?**
*Goal: Understand the core operations. Listen for repetitive verbs: "we manually…", "every day we…", "someone has to…"*

**Q2. How many people are on your team, and what's everyone's role?**
*Goal: Map headcount to functions. Identify who's doing what shouldn't need a human.*

### Block 2: The Pain (3 min)

**Q3. What task does your team complain about the most?**
*Goal: Find the emotional pain point. This is usually the best first automation.*

**Q4. Walk me through what happens when a new lead/client/order comes in.**
*Goal: Map the intake-to-delivery workflow. Every step = potential automation.*

**Q5. How do you handle client communication — email, phone, chat, WhatsApp?**
*Goal: Identify response time bottlenecks and channel sprawl. Chatbot opportunity.*

**Q6. What tools and software do you use? (CRM, email, spreadsheets, etc.)**
*Goal: Assess integration landscape. More tools = more automation potential.*

### Block 3: The Opportunity (3 min)

**Q7. Roughly how many hours per week does your team spend on tasks that feel like they should be automated?**
*Goal: Get their own estimate. They usually lowball — the scorecard will correct it.*

**Q8. Have you tried any automation or AI tools before? What happened?**
*Goal: Gauge sophistication and past failures. Tailor your pitch accordingly.*

**Q9. If you could wave a magic wand and automate one thing tomorrow, what would it be?**
*Goal: Their #1 priority. This becomes the "quick win" in your proposal.*

**Q10. What would your team do with 10-15 extra hours per week?**
*Goal: Make the ROI personal. "Hire fewer people," "focus on sales," "go home on time." Use their own words in the proposal.*

| **Lead/Intake Processing** | ___ hrs | ☐ Yes ☐ Partial ☐ No | €___ /month |

### Calculation

```
Total automatable hours/week × €35 (avg loaded cost) × 4.3 (weeks/month) = Monthly waste
```

**Example:** 14 hrs/week × €35 × 4.3 = **€2,107/month left on the table**

### The Reveal Script

> *"Based on what you've told me, your team is spending roughly **[X] hours per week** on tasks that AI can handle today. At a conservative €35/hour, that's about **€[Y] per month** — or **€[Y×12] per year** — going to work that doesn't need a human.*
>
> *The good news: you don't need to fix everything at once. Here's what I'd recommend starting with…"*

## Recommendation (Pick One)

Based on the score, recommend a tier:

| Monthly Waste | Recommended Tier | Why |
|---|---|---|
| €500-1,000 | **Starter (€500/mo)** | One automation pays for itself. Low risk. |
| €1,000-2,500 | **Growth (€1,500/mo)** | Multiple quick wins. ROI in 3-4 weeks. |
| €2,500+ | **Enterprise (€3,000+/mo)** | Significant waste. Needs a proper system. |

### Next Step Script

> *"I can put together a one-page proposal with exactly what we'd automate first, the timeline, and the expected ROI. No obligation — just so you can see what it'd look like. Want me to send that over?"*
