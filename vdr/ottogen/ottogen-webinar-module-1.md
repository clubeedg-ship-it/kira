## Agenda

### 0:00–0:05 — Opening & Energy Check (5 min)
- Otto intro: "I'm 20, self-taught, and I automate businesses for a living."
- **Interactive:** Quick poll → "How would you describe your AI experience?"
  - 🟢 Already using it daily
  - 🟡 Tried ChatGPT a few times
  - 🔴 Heard of it, haven't touched it
- Set expectations: "By minute 60, you'll have a shortlist of automations you can deploy this week."

### 0:05–0:15 — The SMB AI Gap (10 min)
**Key talking points:**
- 95% of Dutch businesses say they've "adopted AI" — only 5% see real ROI (cite DEV.to / Dutch SME research)
- The gap isn't awareness, it's *implementation*
- Big consultancies charge €200/hr and deliver PowerPoints. You need running systems.
- **The 3 lies SMBs believe about AI:**
  1. "It's too expensive for us" → Most quick wins cost €0–50/month in tools
  2. "We need a data scientist" → You need someone who understands your workflow
  3. "It'll replace my team" → It replaces their worst tasks, not them

**Interactive:** Chat prompt → "Drop in chat: what's the most repetitive task in your business?"

### 0:15–0:35 — The 5 Quick Wins (20 min)
*Live demos, not slides. Screen-share real tools working in real-time.*

**Quick Win 1: Email Triage (3 min)**
- AI classifies incoming emails by urgency/category
- Live demo: show an inbox being auto-sorted
- Time saved: ~3-5 hrs/week

**Quick Win 2: Meeting Notes → Action Items (3 min)**
- Record any meeting → auto-summary + assigned tasks
- Demo: play 30-sec clip, show generated summary
- Time saved: ~2-3 hrs/week

**Quick Win 3: Customer FAQ Chatbot (5 min)**
- Feed your existing FAQ/website into a chatbot
- Demo: build a basic one live in under 3 minutes
- Time saved: ~3-5 hrs/week in support

**Quick Win 4: Document Data Extraction (4 min)**
- Invoices, contracts, forms → structured data automatically
- Demo: upload a sample invoice, show extracted fields
- Time saved: ~2-4 hrs/week

**Quick Win 5: AI-Drafted Content (5 min)**
- Social posts, email campaigns, job listings drafted in seconds
- Demo: generate a LinkedIn post and a job listing live
- Time saved: ~3-5 hrs/week

**Recap slide:** "That's 13–22 hours per week. What would your team do with an extra 2-3 days?"

### 0:35–0:45 — The "What's It Actually Cost?" Breakdown (10 min)
**Key talking points:**
- Tool costs for each quick win (most are €0–50/month)
- DIY vs. done-for-you: when each makes sense
- **The real cost is NOT doing it** — competitor benchmark: "While you're manually sorting emails, your competitor automated it last month"
- ROI math: if your team costs €35/hr and you save 15 hrs/week = €2,275/month in recovered capacity

**Interactive:** Live calculator → "Tell me your team size and average hourly cost, I'll estimate your savings"

### 0:45–0:55 — Your 7-Day AI Action Plan (10 min)
*Give them a concrete plan they can start tomorrow.*

**Day 1-2:** Audit your team's repetitive tasks (provide a simple worksheet)
**Day 3-4:** Pick the #1 time-waster and set up the matching quick win
**Day 5-6:** Test and refine with real work
**Day 7:** Measure time saved, decide what's next

- Provide a downloadable **"AI Quick Win Worksheet"** (PDF)
  - Task audit template
  - Tool recommendations per use case
  - Setup checklists for each quick win
- "If you want to skip the DIY and have someone build all 5 in a week — that's what we do."

### 0:55–1:05 — Live Q&A (10 min)
- Pre-seed 2-3 common questions from registration form
- **Interactive:** Encourage voice questions (unmute), not just chat
- Otto answers with screen-shares when possible — show, don't tell

### 1:05–1:15 — CTA & Close (10 min)

**Primary CTA: Book a Free AI Assessment Call (15 min)**
- "I'll look at your business, identify your top 3 quick wins, and give you a plan — whether you work with me or not."
- Show booking link on screen + drop in chat
- Limited to 10 spots per webinar cohort (scarcity)

**Secondary CTA: SIGNAL Package (€500–€1,000)**
- "If you want all 5 quick wins deployed in your business within 2 weeks, that's our SIGNAL package."
- Brief overview: assessment + up to 3 automations + 90-day roadmap
- "The ROI from quick wins alone typically covers the cost in the first month."

**Tertiary CTA: Join the OttoGen Community**
- LinkedIn newsletter / Telegram group for ongoing tips
- Weekly "AI Tool of the Week" content

**Closing line:** "You don't need to understand AI. You need someone who does and who understands your business. That's what we do."
