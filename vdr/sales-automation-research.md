## 2. IAM Kindergarten Sales Pipeline

### Finding Decision-Makers in Netherlands/Benelux

**The goldmine: Landelijk Register Kinderopvang (LRK)**
- Official Dutch government register of ALL childcare facilities
- URL: https://duo.nl/particulier/landelijk-register-kinderopvang.jsp
- Contains: name, address, type, municipality of every registered kinderopvang
- **~38,000 childcare locations in NL** (kinderdagverblijf, BSO, peuterspeelzaal)
- Public data — can be scraped or downloaded

**How to build your list:**
1. Download/scrape LRK for all "kinderdagverblijf" and "peuterspeelzaal" entries
2. Use Apollo.io or LinkedIn to find directors/managers (locatiemanager, directeur)
3. Enrich with email using Apollo/Hunter.io
4. Large chains to target first: KidsFoundation, Partou, Kindergarden, CompaNanny, Smallsteps

**Key decision-makers:**
- **Locatiemanager** (location manager) — for individual locations
- **Regiomanager** (regional manager) — for chains, controls multiple locations
- **Bestuur/Directie** — board/management for independent kindergartens
- **Inkoop/Facility manager** — for large organizations

### Best Sales Channels (ranked)

1. **LinkedIn + warm DMs** (🏆 #1 for NL) — Dutch business culture values relationships. Connect → value message → demo offer
2. **Phone calls** (#2) — Kindergartens answer phones. Direct, personal. Call 10:00-11:30 or 14:00-15:30 (outside pickup/dropoff)
3. **Email** (#3) — General info@ emails often ignored. Need personal emails.
4. **Trade shows** (#4) — Expensive but high-intent:
   - **Kinderopvang Totaal** (annual, NL) — THE event for childcare
   - **BETT Show** (London) — EdTech, international buyers
   - **Didacta** (Germany) — Education trade fair
5. **Partnerships/Distributors** — See below

### Do Kindergartens Buy Direct or Through Distributors?

**Both, but distributors dominate for hardware:**
- EyeClick sells through **reseller network** (AV integrators, educational suppliers)
- WizeFloor sells through **country distributors** (e.g., WizeFloor UK is a separate entity)
- Dutch educational suppliers: **Heutink**, **De Rolf Groep**, **Nienhuis Montessori**
- AV integrators who serve education: **BIS Group**, **Crestron partners**

**Recommendation:** Start with **direct sales** to prove the product, then recruit 2-3 distributors once you have 10+ reference installations.

### Message That Converts

**Subject line:** "Interactief spelen op de vloer — gratis demo voor [naam locatie]"

**Key angles:**
- Children learn through movement + play (backed by Dutch "spelend leren" philosophy)
- Works for all ages, inclusive for children with special needs
- Low maintenance — no toys to clean/replace
- "Wow factor" for parents → competitive advantage for enrollment
- Already used by [X] kinderdagverblijven in NL (social proof)

**CTA:** Free 30-minute live demo at your location (bring the projector, let kids play)

### Competitor Pricing

**EyeClick:**
- Beam (ceiling-mounted): ~€5,000-€8,000 (hardware only)
- Obie (portable, tabletop/wall): ~€2,500-€4,000
- Software subscription: ~€50-100/mo for content library
- Total first year: €6,000-€10,000+

**WizeFloor:**
- WizeFloor One (mobile stand): ~€6,000-€9,000
- WizeFloor Pro (ceiling): ~€8,000-€12,000
- Content creation app included
- No mandatory subscription

**IAM Pricing Strategy:**
- If hardware cost is lower → undercut at €3,000-€5,000 + €49/mo content
- If comparable → match at €5,000-€7,000 but offer **free trial month**
- Consider **lease model**: €199-299/mo all-in (very attractive for kinderopvang budgets)
- **Demo-to-close rate** in EdTech hardware: typically 20-30% when kids interact with product

### Pricing Models

| Model | When to Use | Range |
|-------|------------|-------|

| **Monthly retainer** | Ongoing optimization/support | €500-€3,000/mo |
| **Value-based** | When you can quantify savings | 10-20% of annual savings |

**DO NOT sell hourly.** It caps your income and clients hate open-ended billing.

**Starter offer:** "AI Automation Audit" — €500-€1,000 flat fee. Analyze their business, identify 3 automatable processes, deliver a roadmap. This converts to project work 40-60% of the time.

   - Format: short text posts, carousels showing workflows, video demos
   - Target: Dutch SMB owners (MKB), operations managers
   - Expected: 1-3 inbound leads/week after 30 days of consistent posting

2. **LinkedIn DMs (warm outreach)**
   - Connect with SMB owners who engage with AI content
   - Message: "Saw you're in [industry]. We helped a similar company automate [X] and save 20 hours/week. Worth a 15-min chat?"
   - Expected: 10-15% reply rate on warm leads

3. **Cold Email (via Instantly)**
   - Target: NL SMBs with 5-50 employees in services (accounting, recruitment, marketing agencies)
   - Use Apollo to find them
   - Expected: 1-3% meeting rate on cold email

4. **Referrals**
   - After first 3 clients, ask for referrals. Offer €200-500 referral bonus.
   - This becomes your #1 channel by month 6.

### Competitor Research — Successful AI Agencies

- **Latenode** — workflow automation, from $17/mo SaaS
- **Relevance AI** — AI agent platform for agencies
- **Floik** — AI demos/guides
- **Most successful model:** Solo consultants on LinkedIn selling €2K-€10K automation projects to SMBs. Not agencies — individuals with personal brands.

## 4. Automation Architecture

### Full Pipeline: Lead → Revenue

```
AUTOMATED                          OTTO DOES THIS
─────────                          ──────────────
1. Lead Sourcing (Apollo)     →    
2. Data Enrichment (Apollo)   →    
3. Email Sequences (Instantly) →   
4. Auto Follow-ups (Instantly) →

                                   7. Proposal/Demo
                                   8. Close
```

### Conversion Rates (Industry Benchmarks)

| Stage | Rate | Numbers (per 1,000 leads) |
|-------|------|--------------------------|
| Leads sourced | 100% | 1,000 |
| Valid email found | 60-70% | 650 |

| Reply | 3-5% | 22 |
| Positive reply | 1-2% | 12 |
| Meeting booked | 0.5-1% | 7 |
| Meeting → Close | 20-30% | 1.5-2 |

**So: 1,000 leads → ~2 customers.** At €3,000 average deal → €6,000 revenue.

### Monthly Stack Cost

| Tool | Cost |
|------|------|
| Apollo.io Free | €0 |
| Instantly Growth | €30 |
| 3x email domains (for rotation) | €15 |
| Cal.com Free | €0 |
| LinkedIn (optional Premium) | €0-40 |
| **Total** | **€45-85/mo** |

### Time to First Revenue

## 5. Quick Wins — This Week

### Path to First €1K (Fastest)

#### OttoGen (fastest path — sell what you already know):

1. **TODAY:** Post on LinkedIn: "I help SMBs automate repetitive tasks with AI. What's the one task you wish you could stop doing manually?" — start conversations
2. **TODAY:** Message 20 people in your network who run small businesses. Offer a free 30-min "AI Automation Audit"
3. **THIS WEEK:** Do 3-5 free audits. At least 1 will say "can you build this for me?"
4. **Close at €1,000-€2,000** for a simple automation (chatbot, email workflow, data pipeline)

**Why this works:** You're selling expertise you already have. Zero tool cost. Just conversations.

#### IAM (slightly slower — needs demos):

1. **THIS WEEK:** Identify the 10 largest kinderopvang chains in NL (Partou, KidsFoundation, etc.)
2. **THIS WEEK:** Find their innovation/facility managers on LinkedIn
3. **Send personal video message** (Loom) showing the product in action
4. **Offer free pilot** at one location for 2 weeks
5. **Close timeline:** 4-8 weeks (procurement in childcare is slow)

### Lowest Friction Actions RIGHT NOW

| Action | Time | Expected Outcome |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| 20 LinkedIn DMs to SMB owners | 2 hours | 3-5 conversations |
| LinkedIn post about AI automation | 30 min | Visibility + inbound |
| Free audit offer to warm network | 1 hour | 1-2 audit calls this week |
| Set up Apollo free account | 30 min | Ready to source leads |
| Set up Instantly + buy 3 domains | 1 hour | Ready to send in 2 weeks |
| Register at Cal.com | 15 min | Booking link ready |

### The €1K Formula

**OttoGen:** 20 DMs → 5 calls → 2 audits → 1 close at €1,500-€2,500 = **€1,500+ in 1-2 weeks**

**IAM:** Not possible in 1 week. Hardware sales cycle is 4-8 weeks minimum. But starting outreach now means revenue in March.
