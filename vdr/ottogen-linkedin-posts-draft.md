## Post 1: Introduction / Origin Story

**Hook:** I started building AI systems because I had nothing to lose.

At 18, I moved to the Netherlands alone. No money. No network. No safety net.

I slept on floors. I built PCs from parts. I taught myself everything — markets, neuroscience, machine learning — because no one was going to teach me.

Now I'm building something different: AI that works FOR people, not on them.

→ Privacy-preserving. Distributed. Can't be shut down.
→ Not another ChatGPT wrapper. Real infrastructure.

This is OttoGen — where I share what I'm building and why.

Follow along if you care about AI that doesn't require you to hand over your data.

## Post 2: Problem/Insight Post

**Hook:** Every AI company has the same dirty secret: they need your data more than you need their product.

Think about it:
- Your prompts train their models
- Your files sit on their servers
- Your workflows become their competitive moat

What if AI could help you without ever seeing your data?

That's what we're building with Chimera Protocol:
🔹 Your data stays on YOUR device
🔹 AI tasks execute blindly — compute without access
🔹 Zero-knowledge proofs verify results without exposing inputs

It's not theoretical. We have 162 tests passing and a working prototype.

The future of AI isn't bigger models. It's smarter architecture.

More soon. 🧬
