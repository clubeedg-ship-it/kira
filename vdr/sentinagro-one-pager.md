**Autonomous Drone-Based Cattle Monitoring · AI-Powered Herd Intelligence**

*An Oopuo Group Company · Target Markets: Brazil & Europe*

## The Problem

Global cattle ranching operates across vast, often remote landscapes — yet herd monitoring remains manual, infrequent, and reactive. Ranchers managing thousands of hectares face a persistent set of costly failures:

- **Lost and stolen cattle** due to inadequate tracking across open terrain
- **Late disease detection** — lameness, respiratory illness, and parasitic infections go unnoticed until they spread
- **Inefficient grazing** leading to overuse of pastures and degraded land productivity
- **Infrastructure blind spots** — broken fences, dry water points, and encroachment detected too late

These inefficiencies cost the global cattle industry **billions annually** in preventable losses, reduced yield, and degraded land value.

## The Solution

**SentinAgro** deploys autonomous drone patrols equipped with AI-powered computer vision to deliver continuous, intelligent herd oversight:

| Capability | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Herd Counting & Tracking** | Automated headcount and geolocation across large areas |
| **Health Anomaly Detection** | Identifies lameness, isolation behavior, and body condition changes |
| **Grazing Optimization** | Maps pasture utilization and recommends rotation schedules |
| **Infrastructure Monitoring** | Detects fence breaches, water level issues, and land encroachment |

Drones operate on scheduled patrol routes with real-time alerts and weekly insight reports delivered through a simple dashboard — no piloting skills required.

## Market Opportunity

SentinAgro sits at the intersection of two fast-growing sectors:

- **Precision Livestock Farming** — projected at $7–8B globally by 2030
- **Agricultural Drones** — surpassing $2B+ and accelerating

Our serviceable market — AI-driven aerial cattle monitoring — represents a **TAM of $500M–$1.5B by 2030**, with cattle as the dominant livestock segment by economic value. Brazil alone holds **220M+ head of cattle** across 170M hectares of pasture; Europe adds significant demand driven by regulatory pressure on animal welfare and sustainability reporting.

## Business Model

**Hardware lease + SaaS subscription** — low barrier to entry for ranchers, predictable recurring revenue.

| Plan | Coverage | Price |
|---|---|---|
| Standard | Per 1,000 hectares | **€500/month** |

Pricing scales with area. Includes drone hardware, maintenance, software platform, and AI analytics. No upfront capital expenditure for the farmer.

## Competitive Edge

- **Proprietary AI models** trained on real cattle behavior data — not generic object detection
- **Seamless integration** with existing farm management and ERP systems
- **Edge processing via Chimera** — Oopuo's distributed AI infrastructure enables on-site inference with low latency and offline resilience
- **Dual-market positioning** — localized for both Brazilian extensive ranching and European regulatory environments

## Team

SentinAgro is built within the **Oopuo Group**, which brings:

- **Hardware deployment expertise** — proven through Interactive Move's commercial robotics operations
- **AI and distributed systems** — via Chimera Protocol, Oopuo's edge AI infrastructure
- **Cross-border operational experience** — active in both European and Latin American markets

## The Ask

We are seeking:

- **Strategic partners** in agritech, livestock genetics, or rural connectivity
- **Pilot farm operators** in Brazil and/or Europe for validation deployments (Q2–Q3 2026)

**Pre-seed round planned for Q3 2026.**
