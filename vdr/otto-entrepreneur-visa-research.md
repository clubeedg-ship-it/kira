## 1. Dutch Entrepreneur Visa

### What It Is
The **"Verblijfsvergunning voor arbeid als zelfstandige"** (Residence permit for self-employed persons) — issued by IND (Immigration and Naturalisation Service). This is NOT the startup visa; it's the general self-employment permit.

### The Points System (RVO Assessment)
The Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO) evaluates applications using a **scoring system requiring minimum 90 points** across three categories:

| Category | What's Assessed | Minimum Points |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **A: Personal Experience** | Education, work experience, entrepreneurial track record, connections to NL | 30 pts (or 45 if skipping C) |
| **B: Business Plan** | Quality, expected revenue/profit, feasibility, market analysis | 30 pts (or 45 if skipping C) |
| **C: Added Value to Dutch Economy** | Innovation, job creation, investment in patents/equipment | 30 pts |

**Two paths to qualify:**
- Score ≥30 in ALL three categories (total ≥90), OR
- Score ≥45 in both A and B (Category C not needed)

**⚠️ Rejection rate is ~90%.** This is not easy. Strong evidence is critical.

### Exemptions from Points System
- US, Japanese, or Turkish nationals (treaty exemptions)
- Long-term EU residents from other EU countries

**Otto's nationality matters here.** If he holds a Brazilian passport only — full points system applies. If he has any treaty-country citizenship, different rules.

### Financial Requirements

| Requirement | Amount | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Minimum capital in Dutch business account** | €4,500 | Must remain available; shown via bank statement |
| **Startup equity** | €25,000 | Shown via bank statements |
| **First-year revenue projection** | €50,000 | Supported by contracts, LOIs, evidence |
| **Sustainable income (for renewal)** | ~€1,657/month (from month 7+) | Inflation-adjusted annually |
| **Application fee** | €423 | Paid within 3 weeks of application |

### Required Documents (Full Checklist)

- [ ] Valid passport (≥6 months validity, 2 blank pages)

### Application Process

**Step 1: Prepare Business Plan + Evidence**
- Write comprehensive business plan addressing all RVO scoring criteria
- Gather supporting evidence (contracts, financials, references)

**Step 2: Apply for MVV + Residence Permit**
- If applying from abroad (which Otto will be): Apply at Dutch embassy/consulate
- In Brazil: Dutch Consulate-General in **São Paulo**
- Submit IND form 7558 + all documents
- Provide biometrics (fingerprints, photo) at appointment

**Step 3: RVO Assessment**
- Embassy forwards application to IND → IND sends to RVO
- RVO evaluates business plan against points system
- RVO advises IND (up to 3 months)

**Step 4: IND Decision**
- Processing time: **90 days** (extendable to 6 months)
- If approved: MVV visa sticker placed in passport (valid ~90 days)
- Must enter NL within MVV validity

**Step 5: Arrive in Netherlands**
- Collect biometric residence permit at IND desk within 2 weeks
- Register with KvK within 6 weeks (needs BSN)
- Register at municipality (get BSN number)
- Get Dutch health insurance

### Can You Apply from Brazil?
**YES.** Apply at the Dutch Consulate-General in São Paulo. The process:
1. Book appointment online at consulate
2. Submit documents + biometrics
3. Consulate forwards to IND
4. Wait for decision (90 days to 6 months)
5. If approved, collect MVV sticker from consulate (within 3 months of approval)
6. Travel to Netherlands within MVV validity

**⚠️ Important:** You have only **3 months** from IND approval to collect MVV at consulate. Plan accordingly.

### Do You Need a Sponsor?
For self-employed: Generally **no recognized sponsor needed** (unlike employee permits). Your own business can serve as the basis. However, having a Dutch accountant/lawyer submit on your behalf is strongly recommended.

### Permit Duration
- Initial: **2 years** (some sources say 1 year)
- Renewable if: positive cash flow, €4,500 capital intact, income ≥€1,657/month
- After 5 years: eligible for permanent residence

## 2. Schengen Exit Strategy

### The Problem
**As of January 1, 2025, ALL countries bordering the Netherlands by land are Schengen members.** Romania, Bulgaria, and Croatia all joined full Schengen (including land borders) by January 2025.

### Reachable Non-Schengen Countries (by car, through Schengen)

| Country | Drive from NL | Schengen? | Flight connections to Brazil |
|---------|--------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Serbia** | ~16-18h (via Austria/Hungary) | ❌ Non-Schengen | Decent — via Istanbul, Frankfurt |
| **Bosnia & Herzegovina** | ~18-20h (via Austria/Slovenia/Croatia) | ❌ Non-Schengen | Limited — via Istanbul mainly |
| **Montenegro** | ~20-22h | ❌ Non-Schengen | Very limited |
| **Albania** | ~22-24h | ❌ Non-Schengen | Very limited |
| **North Macedonia** | ~20-22h | ❌ Non-Schengen | Very limited |
| **UK** | Ferry from NL (Harwich/Hook of Holland) ~7h + drive | ❌ Non-Schengen | Excellent — direct flights to São Paulo |
| **Ireland** | Ferry from UK or fly | ❌ Non-Schengen | Good connections |

### 🏆 Recommended Options

**Option A: UK via Ferry (BEST for flights to Brazil)**
- Drive to Hook of Holland → Stena Line ferry to Harwich (~7 hours)
- Or Eurostar/Channel Tunnel via France to UK
- Fly London → São Paulo (direct flights with British Airways, LATAM ~11-12h)
- **Pros:** Best flight connections, direct flights to Brazil, English-speaking
- **Cons:** Need to check UK visa requirements for Otto's nationality; ferry cost ~€100-300

**Option B: Serbia via car (BEST for clean Schengen exit stamp)**
- Drive NL → Austria → Hungary → Serbia (~16-18h, doable in 2 days)
- Fly Belgrade → São Paulo (1-2 stops, via Istanbul/Frankfurt, ~€400-600)
- **Pros:** Clear non-Schengen exit stamp, 90-day visa-free stay, cheap
- **Cons:** Longer drive, fewer direct flights

**Option C: Bosnia & Herzegovina**
- Similar to Serbia route but less convenient for flights
- Not recommended over Serbia

### ⚠️ Border Considerations
- **Schengen exit:** When leaving the Schengen zone (entering Serbia/Bosnia), passport WILL be stamped. This documents the exit.
- **If Otto has overstayed Schengen 90/180 rule:** The exit stamp will show this. Could result in:
  - Fine at border
  - Entry ban (up to 5 years for significant overstay)
  - **This needs legal advice BEFORE leaving**
- **Vehicle:** Need Green Card insurance for non-Schengen Balkans
- **UK entry:** Separate immigration — check visa requirements for Otto's passport

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Overstay Risk
If Otto is currently in NL without proper status, leaving Schengen will expose this at the border. He should:
1. Consult an immigration lawyer IN the Netherlands first
2. Understand the consequences of the exit stamp showing overstay
3. Consider whether voluntary departure with a lawyer's help could mitigate penalties
4. An overstay record could HURT the entrepreneur visa application

## 3. Brazil → Argentina Travel

### Visa Requirements

| Passport | Brazil Entry | Argentina Entry |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Dutch passport** | Visa-free, 90 days per 180-day period | Visa-free, 90 days |
| **Brazilian passport** | N/A (citizen) | Visa-free, 90 days |

No visa needed for either country with either passport type.

### Travel Options

**By Flight (Recommended):**
- São Paulo (GRU) → Buenos Aires (EZE): ~3-3.5 hours
- Airlines: LATAM, Aerolíneas Argentinas, Gol, Flybondi
- Cost: **€80-250 one-way** depending on timing/airline
- Multiple daily flights

**By Bus:**
- São Paulo → Buenos Aires: ~30-36 hours
- Companies: Crucero del Norte, Pluma
- Cost: **€50-120 one-way**
- Scenic route through southern Brazil/Uruguay possible

**By Car:**
- Possible but very long (~30+ hours driving)
- Border crossing at Foz do Iguaçu / Puerto Iguazú is common
- Can combine with visiting Iguazu Falls

### Approximate Costs Summary
| Route | Flight | Bus |
|-------|--------|-----|
| São Paulo → Buenos Aires | €100-250 | €50-120 |
| Rio → Buenos Aires | €120-280 | €70-150 |
| Florianópolis → Buenos Aires | €80-200 | €40-100 |

### Argentina Practical Notes
- **Currency:** Argentine Peso (ARS) — extreme inflation, USD/EUR cash gets excellent rates
- **Blue dollar rate:** Check informal exchange rate (much better than official)
- **Buenos Aires is very affordable** for Europeans at current rates
- **Travel insurance:** Recommended but not mandatory for entry

## 5. Financial Requirements Deep Dive

### Exact Amounts Needed

| Item | Amount | Purpose |

| Business bank account minimum | **€4,500** | Must stay in account; IND checks this |
| Startup equity proof | **€25,000** | Bank statement showing this available |
| First-year revenue projection | **€50,000** | In business plan, supported by evidence |
| Living expenses proof | **~€1,657/month** (~€20,000/year) | Shown through projections or savings |
| Application fee | **€423** | Paid to IND |
| **Total cash needed** | **~€30,000-50,000** | Between deposits, living costs, fees |

### Acceptable Proof

**Bank Statements:**
- Dutch business bank account statements (last 3-6 months)
- Show €4,500 minimum balance maintained
- Show €25,000 startup capital

**Revenue Evidence:**

**Financial Projections:**
- 2-year income projection
- Must be certified/prepared by registered Dutch bookkeeper or accountant
- Include opening balance sheet

### Does Oopuo / Otto's Existing Companies Count?

**Yes, but structure matters:**

1. **If Oopuo is the Dutch entity:** Its revenue, clients, and track record directly support the application. This is ideal.

2. **If Oopuo is a foreign company:** Otto could register a Dutch branch (KvK) or create a new Dutch BV that contracts with Oopuo. The Dutch entity needs to show Dutch economic benefit.

3. **Recommended structure:**
   - Register a **Dutch BV** (or eenmanszaak)
   - This entity contracts with existing clients or Oopuo entities
   - Revenue flows through Dutch entity
   - Shows Dutch economic activity
   - Accountant certifies projections based on existing business relationships

4. **Key for IND:** They want to see that the business benefits the **Dutch economy** — not just a shell. Evidence of:
   - Dutch clients or Dutch market activity
   - Local hiring potential
   - Innovation or unique expertise
   - Existing contracts/revenue

### Business Plan Requirements

The business plan is THE most critical document. It must address all RVO scoring categories:

**Section 1: Personal Experience (Category A)**
- Educational background and qualifications
- Previous entrepreneurial experience
- Industry expertise and track record
- Connections to the Netherlands (clients, partners, networks)
- Why Netherlands specifically

**Section 2: Business Viability (Category B)**
- Executive summary
- Market analysis (Dutch/EU market)
- Products/services description
- Revenue model
- 2-year financial projections (accountant-certified)
- Marketing strategy
- Competitive analysis
- SWOT analysis
- Risk management

**Section 3: Added Value to Dutch Economy (Category C)**
- Innovation (what's new/unique)
- Job creation plans
- Investment in Netherlands (office, equipment, IP)
- Partnerships with Dutch companies
- Export potential
- Knowledge transfer

**Format:** Professional, evidence-based, 20-40 pages with appendices

---

## 6. Risk Assessment & Recommendations

### 🔴 HIGH RISK: Current Immigration Status
If Otto is in NL without valid residence status:
- Leaving Schengen creates a record of overstay
- Overstay can result in entry ban (1-5 years)
- Entry ban would **prevent** entrepreneur visa approval
- **ACTION:** Consult immigration lawyer IMMEDIATELY — before any travel plans

### 🟡 MEDIUM RISK: 90% Rejection Rate
Self-employment permits have very high rejection rates.
- **Mitigation:** Hire specialized immigration lawyer (€2,000-5,000)
- Get professional help with business plan
- Ensure all scoring criteria are thoroughly addressed
- Have Dutch accountant certify financials

### 🟢 RECOMMENDED APPROACH
1. **Lawyer first** — sort out current status, get professional advice
2. **Set up Dutch BV** — via notary, with proper structure
3. **Bank account + deposits** — do this while still in NL
4. **Business plan** — hire professional to help write it
5. **Exit Schengen cleanly** — UK ferry is best for flights; Serbia if cleaner exit needed
6. **Apply from São Paulo** — consulate appointment, submit everything
7. **Wait in Brazil/Argentina** — 3-6 months for decision
8. **Return to NL with MVV** — if approved

### Estimated Total Budget

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Immigration lawyer (NL) | €2,000-5,000 |
| Business plan consultant | €1,000-3,000 |
| Dutch accountant | €500-1,500 |
| KvK / BV setup | €75-1,500 |
| Bank deposits required | €25,000-30,000 |
| IND application fee | €423 |
| Travel (NL → non-Schengen → Brazil) | €500-1,500 |
| Living costs Brazil/Argentina (4-6 months) | €3,000-6,000 |
| Return flight to NL | €500-800 |
| Dutch health insurance (first months) | €300-600 |
| **TOTAL** | **€33,000-50,000** |
