# Abura Cosmetics Sales Expansion Research

**Date:** February 2, 2026  
**Website:** https://aburacosmetics.com/  
**Status:** Ready for Pipeline Development

---

## Executive Summary

Abura Cosmetics is a premium, Netherlands-based natural skincare brand offering organic body and face oils with a unique cultural positioning blending African and Mediterranean beauty rituals. The brand occupies the **premium-accessible** price tier (€15-€35) with strong certifications (COSMOS Organic, Vegan, PETA Cruelty-Free).

**Key Opportunity:** The brand has exceptional product-market fit for both B2C (conscious consumers) and B2B (luxury spas, boutique hotels, clean beauty retailers). Currently appears to be D2C-focused with limited wholesale infrastructure—presenting a significant untapped expansion opportunity.

**Recommended Focus:**
1. **Immediate:** B2B outreach to luxury spas, wellness hotels, and boutique retailers
2. **Parallel:** Influencer partnerships and marketplace expansion
3. **Medium-term:** Trade show presence and wholesale platform listings
