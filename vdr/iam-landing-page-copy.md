## 2. The Challenge

### Keeping Children Active, Engaged, and Developing — Every Single Day

Running a childcare center means juggling a lot. You know movement and play are essential for healthy development, but:

- **Limited space** makes it hard to offer varied physical activities, especially on rainy days
- **Screen time is rising** — parents and inspectors expect you to offer alternatives, not more tablets
- **Children have different needs** — some need calming sensory input, others need high-energy outlets
- **Staff are stretched thin** — setting up elaborate activities takes time you don't have
- **Equipment gets boring fast** — the same toys and games lose their magic within weeks
- **Inclusive play is difficult** — children with different abilities need activities that adapt to them

You need something that keeps every child moving, learning, and laughing — without adding to your team's workload.

## 3. The Solution

### Interactive Move: Where Floors and Walls Come Alive

Interactive Move projection systems turn ordinary surfaces into dynamic, interactive play environments. Children step, jump, wave, and move — and the floor or wall responds instantly.

**🎯 Proven Developmental Impact**
Every game is designed around motor skills, cognitive development, and social interaction. Play with purpose — backed by pedagogy.

**⚡ Effortless for Staff**
One button to start. No setup, no cleanup, no instruction manual. Staff can facilitate or let children explore independently.

**🔄 Always Fresh Content**
A growing library of games and activities means children never get bored. New content is added regularly — no extra cost.

**🧒 Inclusive by Design**
Activities adapt to different ages, abilities, and energy levels. From toddlers to school-age children, from wheelchairs to running shoes.

**📐 Fits Any Space**
Floor projection, wall projection, or both. Works in small rooms, large halls, corridors — wherever you have a surface and a ceiling.

**🛡️ Built to Last**
No moving parts on the floor. No screens to break. Industrial-grade projector mounted safely overhead. Designed for the reality of childcare.

## 4. How It Works

### Up and Running in Three Steps

**Step 1 — We Design Your Setup**
Tell us about your space. We'll recommend the right system — floor, wall, or combination — tailored to your room dimensions and goals.

**Step 2 — Professional Installation**
Our team installs everything: projector, sensor, and software. Mounted on the ceiling, out of children's reach. Typical installation takes less than a day.

**Step 3 — Play Starts Immediately**
Power on, select a game, and watch children light up. Your team gets a short introduction, but honestly — the children figure it out in seconds.

## 7. Frequently Asked Questions

**How much space do I need?**
A floor projection works in spaces as small as 3×3 meters. Wall projections need even less. We'll assess your room and recommend the best configuration during your free consultation.

**Is it safe for young children?**
Absolutely. There's nothing on the floor — no cables, no hardware. The projector and sensor are mounted on the ceiling, completely out of reach. Children interact with projected light, nothing more.

**What kind of games and activities are included?**
The system comes with a library of 100+ activities spanning motor skills, math, language, sensory play, and free creative play. New games are added regularly through software updates.

**Do staff need technical training?**
No. The system starts with a single button press, and the touchscreen menu is intuitive. We provide a short introduction at installation, but most teams are confident within minutes.

**What about maintenance and support?**
The systems are designed to be maintenance-free. If anything does come up, our support team is a phone call away. We offer service agreements for complete peace of mind.
