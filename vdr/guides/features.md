# Kira — Feature Overview

## Core Platform

### 🤖 AI Chat Partner
A persistent AI conversation that remembers everything. Kira doesn't just answer questions — she takes action, creates documents, manages tasks, and learns from every interaction.

Unlike generic chatbots, Kira works within *your* context. She knows your projects, your preferences, and your history.

### 📋 Task & Goal Management
Track individual tasks and larger objectives. Tasks can be created manually or through conversation. Kira can remind you about deadlines, flag overdue items, and help prioritize your work.

**Tasks** are concrete actions. **Goals** are outcomes that group related tasks together.

### 📁 Document Vault
Your private document storage. Upload files, organize them into folders, and let Kira reference them during conversations. Supports markdown, text, and structured data formats.

Every user gets their own isolated vault — your files are completely private.

### 🧠 Knowledge Graph
Kira automatically builds a connected network of everything she learns: people, companies, projects, concepts, decisions, and their relationships.

Over time, this becomes a searchable, visual map of your professional world. Ask Kira about any entity and she can trace its connections.

### 📊 Morning Brief
Start each day with an AI-generated summary tailored to you:
- Tasks due today and this week
- Recent activity and updates
- Key metrics at a glance
- Contextual suggestions

### ⏰ Scheduled Automations
Set up recurring jobs that Kira runs on autopilot:
- Daily reports and summaries
- Periodic check-ins and reminders
- Data monitoring and alerts
- Automated content generation

## Architecture

### Privacy by Design
- **Per-user data isolation** — Separate storage for every account
- **No cross-user data access** — Architecturally impossible, not just policy
- **Your instance, your data** — Nothing shared between accounts

### AI Models
Kira connects to leading AI providers. Your administrator configures which models are available. The platform supports multiple providers and can switch between them based on task requirements.

### Real-Time Sync
Conversations and data update live. No page refreshes needed. When Kira is working on a complex task, you see progress in real-time.
