# Chat — Talking to Kira

## How It Works

Kira's chat isn't a search bar. It's a persistent conversation with an AI that knows your context, remembers your history, and can take real actions.

Messages sync in real-time. When Kira is working on something complex, you'll see her thought process unfold live.

## Understanding Message Blocks

Kira's responses sometimes include expandable blocks that show her work:

### 🧠 Thinking
Kira's internal reasoning. Click to expand and see how she arrived at her answer. Useful when you want to understand her logic or verify her approach.

### 🔧 Tool Use
When Kira uses a tool — running code, searching files, calling an API — this block shows what she did. The tool name appears in the header.

### 📋 Result
The output from a tool. Raw data that Kira then interprets and explains in her main response.

These blocks are collapsed by default to keep the conversation clean. Click any header to expand it.

Kira can dive deep:

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific.** "Analyze Q1 revenue by segment" beats "tell me about revenue."

2. **Give context.** "Based on yesterday's meeting, draft action items" helps Kira connect the dots.

3. **Ask follow-ups.** Kira maintains context within a conversation. Build on previous messages.

4. **Use her memory.** Kira remembers past conversations. Reference them: "Remember when we discussed the pricing model?"

5. **Let her show her work.** If an answer seems off, expand the thinking block to see her reasoning. You can correct course.
