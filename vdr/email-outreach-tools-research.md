# Email Outreach Tools Research — IAM Kindergarten Leads

*Researched: 2026-02-10*

## Recommendation: Apollo.io (already in Notion backlog)

Apollo.io is the best fit for IAM because:
- Already a planned task (Set up Apollo.io for IAM lead tracking)
- Combines B2B database with email sequencing
- Can search by industry (childcare/education) and geography (Netherlands)
- Free tier available (good for bootstrapped start)

## Top Alternatives

| Tool | Price | Best For | Key Feature |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Apollo.io** | Free tier + $49/mo | B2B database + outreach | Built-in lead database, NL childcare orgs findable |
| **Saleshandy** | $25/mo | Budget-friendly sequences | AI sequence generator, unlimited accounts |
| **Lemlist** | ~$59/mo | Personalization | Strong deliverability, multichannel |
| **Snov.io** | $30/mo | All-in-one | Email verifier (<3% bounce), built-in CRM |
| **Gmass** | $25/mo | Gmail users, simple | Easiest learning curve |

## Recommended Stack for IAM

1. **Apollo.io** — Find Dutch kindergartens, BSOs, childcare chains (Partou, KidsFoundation, Smallsteps, etc.)
2. **Saleshandy or Gmass** — Send the cold email sequence (see iam-cold-outreach-sequence.md)
3. **Google Sheets** — Track responses until CRM needed

## Dutch Kindergarten Lead Sources

- **KVK (Kamer van Koophandel)** — search SBI code 88.91 (kinderopvang)
- **LRK (Landelijk Register Kinderopvang)** — government registry of all licensed childcare
- **Kinderopvang Totaal** — industry directory
- **Apollo.io** — filter by industry + country
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** — search "kinderopvang" decision makers

## Next Steps

1. Set up Apollo.io free account
2. Import Dutch childcare organizations
3. Load email sequence from iam-cold-outreach-sequence.md
4. Start with 20 leads/week, A/B test subject lines
