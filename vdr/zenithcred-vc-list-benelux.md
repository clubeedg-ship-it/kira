## Notes
- Several of these investors co-invest regularly — landing one Tier 1 investor often opens doors to others
- Public investors (PMV, LRM, Noshaq) can be stacked with private VC rounds and regional subsidies
- The €1.1M round fits well within typical Benelux seed check sizes (€500K–€3M)
- Interactive Move's proven hardware + revenue history is a strong differentiator vs pure-software wellness startups
