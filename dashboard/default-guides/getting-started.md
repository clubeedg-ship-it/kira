# Getting Started with Kira

## What is Kira?

Kira is your AI-powered command center. She's not a chatbot — she's a partner who remembers everything, manages your work, and takes action on your behalf.

Think of Kira as a chief of staff who never sleeps, never forgets, and gets smarter the more you work together.

## Your Dashboard

When you log in, you land on the **Overview** — a snapshot of everything that matters right now:

- **Tasks** — What needs doing, what's overdue, what's coming up
- **Goals** — The bigger picture: objectives you're working toward
- **Knowledge** — Entities and connections Kira has learned about your world
- **System** — Server health, resource usage, uptime

Use the sidebar to navigate between sections. On mobile, the navigation moves to the bottom of your screen.

## First Steps

### 1. Open Chat
Click **Chat** in the sidebar. This is where you talk to Kira. She can:
- Answer questions about your data
- Create tasks and set reminders
- Analyze documents you've uploaded
- Research topics and summarize findings
- Run automations and scheduled jobs

### 2. Upload Documents
Go to **Documents** and start adding files. Kira can read markdown, text, and structured data. The more context she has, the better she performs.

### 3. Review Your Knowledge Graph
Click **Knowledge** to see what Kira knows. She automatically extracts people, companies, concepts, and their relationships from your conversations and documents.

### 4. Set Up Tasks
Use **Tasks** to track your work. You can create tasks manually or ask Kira to create them for you in chat.

## How Kira Learns

Kira gets better over time through three mechanisms:

1. **Conversations** — Everything you discuss builds context
2. **Documents** — Files you upload become part of her knowledge
3. **Memory** — She remembers decisions, preferences, and patterns across sessions

You don't need to "train" Kira. Just use her. She learns by working with you.

## Privacy & Security

- **Your data is yours.** Each user has completely isolated storage — your documents, conversations, and knowledge graph are invisible to other users.
- **No data sharing.** Nothing leaves your instance unless you explicitly ask for it.
- **Per-user encryption path.** Your files live in a dedicated directory that no other account can access.

## Need Help?

Just ask Kira in chat. She knows this documentation and can walk you through anything.
