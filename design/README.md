# Kira — Product Design

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** February 11, 2026
**Status:** Design Phase — No Code Until Complete

## What Is Kira?

An installable AI partner that connects to your Anthropic subscription and gives you:
- A multi-agent system that works autonomously on your goals
- Memory that persists across sessions (4-layer: episodic/semantic/procedural/working)
- A dashboard that's better than Notion + Obsidian combined — because agents live inside it
- Interactive visual components generated by AI in real-time
- Cross-platform chat (Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, web dashboard)
- Self-evolving agents that update their own goals, log decisions, and learn

## Design Principles

1. **Design first, code never (until design is done)**
2. **Every screen described before any pixel is drawn**
3. **Every data flow mapped before any API is written**
4. **Every agent role defined before any prompt is crafted**
5. **Superior to Notion/Obsidian because agents live inside the product**

## The Promise

Kira is what happens when you put AI agents INSIDE your productivity tool instead of alongside it. Notion is a database with pretty views. Obsidian is a note-taking graph. Kira is an intelligent partner that:
- Reads your documents and extracts tasks automatically
- Researches topics while you sleep
- Generates interactive visual components to help you decide
- Learns your preferences and adapts
- Manages itself — self-healing, self-updating, self-improving
