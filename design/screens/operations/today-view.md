# Today View

> **Status:** 🔴 SCAFFOLD | **Phase:** 1

Daily execution view — just today's scheduled tasks with time blocks.

## Layout
- Vertical timeline (morning to evening)
- Time blocks as colored sections (mapped to areas)
- Tasks within each time block
- Calendar events interspersed
- Top 3 priorities highlighted at the top
- Input queue count badge

## Interactions
- Drag tasks between time blocks

- Click task to open detail
- Quick-add to current time block

## TODO
- Wireframe
- Time block color mapping
- How unscheduled tasks appear
- Overflow handling (too many tasks for a time block)
