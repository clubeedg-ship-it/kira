# Review View — Review Ceremonies

> **Status:** ✅ DESIGNED | **Phase:** 3
> **Route:** `/operations/review/:type` (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual)
> **Purpose:** Templated, guided review sessions that enforce the SOP operating rhythm. The system generates the review content; the user walks through it, makes decisions, and captures insights.

---

## 1. Design Intent

Reviews are the enforcement mechanism for the SOP engine. Without regular reviews, tasks pile up, projects drift, and objectives fail silently. The Review View makes reviews effortless by pre-generating all the data and presenting it as a guided checklist.

The heartbeat process triggers reviews at the right cadence. When triggered, an input_queue item appears. Opening it launches the Review View with all relevant data pre-loaded.
