# Board View (Kanban)

> **Status:** 🔴 SCAFFOLD | **Phase:** 1

Kanban columns by status — per-project or per-area.

## TODO
- Column definitions (maps to task status machine)
- Card anatomy (title, priority badge, executor icon, due date)
- Drag-and-drop between columns (triggers state transition)
- Column WIP limits (optional)
- Swimlanes (by project, by executor)
- Quick-add at top of column
- Filtering controls
