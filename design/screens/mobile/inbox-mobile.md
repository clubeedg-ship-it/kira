Tinder-style card swipe for input queue items.

## Interaction Pattern
- Swipe right = Approve
- Swipe left = Dismiss/Snooze
- Tap = Open detail view
- Long press = More options

## TODO
- Card design for each input queue type (verify/decide/create)
- Swipe animations and feedback
- Batch mode toggle
- Filter controls (compact)
