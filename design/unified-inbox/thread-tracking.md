# Thread Tracking

> **Status:** 🔴 SCAFFOLD | **Phase:** 5

Grouping related messages across channels.

## Thread Detection
- Same channel: native thread/reply-to linking
- Cross-channel: entity matching (same person, same topic, same project)
- Conversation continuity: if user discusses same topic across WhatsApp and email

## TODO
- Thread linking algorithm
- Cross-channel identity resolution
- Thread UI in inbox (collapsed/expanded)
- Thread summary generation
