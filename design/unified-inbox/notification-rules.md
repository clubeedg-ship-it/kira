# Notification Rules

> **Status:** 🔴 SCAFFOLD | **Phase:** 5

What surfaces immediately, what batches, DND rules.

## TODO
- Urgency classification → notification timing
- Channel-specific rules (WhatsApp from key contacts = immediate)
- Area-based rules (Business area = business hours only)
- DND schedule configuration
- Batching logic (morning digest, evening summary)
- Escalation rules (unanswered urgent → re-notify)
