# Design System & Visual Language

> **Status:** 🔴 SCAFFOLD | **Phase:** 0
> **Priority:** Must be completed before any screen design.

## TODO
- Color palette (primary, secondary, accent, semantic: success/warning/error/info)
- Typography scale (font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
- Spacing scale (4px base unit, spacing tokens)
- Elevation system (shadows for cards, modals, dropdowns)
- Border radii (consistent rounding)
- Animation principles (duration, easing curves)
- Dark mode / Light mode color mapping
- Accessibility (contrast ratios, focus indicators, screen reader patterns)
