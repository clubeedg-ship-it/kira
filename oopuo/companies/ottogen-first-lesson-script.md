# OttoGen.io — First Online Meeting Script

**Format:** Live webinar/call for SMB owners
**Goal:** Consultancy revenue + leads for AI systems
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes

---

## Part 1: The Hook (5 min)

**Opening:**
> "Most AI advice tells you to 'learn prompting.' But I'm about to show you why that's already becoming obsolete — and what you should be focusing on instead."

**Establish credibility quickly:**
- Running 6 companies with AI infrastructure
- Not a course seller — a practitioner showing what works
- "I'll show you real systems, not theory"

---

## Part 2: The Problem (10 min)

### Current AI Pain Points for SMBs
- "AI can do amazing things... when you know how to ask"
- Prompting fatigue: every task needs a new prompt
- No memory: every conversation starts from zero
- No integration: AI lives in a browser tab, separate from your workflow
- Time cost: you become the AI's assistant instead of the reverse

**Key question to audience:**
> "How many hours per week do you spend copying/pasting between ChatGPT and your actual work?"

### The Limitation They Don't See
- Current tools are single-turn, isolated, stateless
- No continuity, no learning, no proactive action
- "You're using a calculator when you could have an analyst"

---

## Part 3: The Future (10 min)

### What Changes Everything
1. **Memory** — AI that remembers your business, your clients, your preferences
2. **Voice** — Talk naturally, get context-aware responses
3. **Agents** — AI that takes action, not just gives answers
4. **Multi-agent** — Teams of specialized AIs coordinating

**Demo tease:**
> "Let me show you what this looks like in practice..."

### Quick Demo (if possible)
- Show a voice assistant reading messages
- Show an agent responding with business context
- Show automated workflow

**Reaction seed:**
> "Now imagine this running 24/7, handling client inquiries, scheduling, research, drafting... while you focus on strategy."
