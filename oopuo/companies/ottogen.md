**Status:** Pre-launch
**Model:** AI education → Lead gen → System sales

## Strategy

### Phase 1: Content Hook
- "Why I stopped teaching prompts"
- Show current AI limitations
- Tease advanced systems (voice agents, multi-agent)
- Target: AI-curious SMB owners

### Phase 2: Community Building
- Free value → email list
- TikTok/IG for Gen-Z (freedom, post-labour)
- Discord/Telegram community

### Phase 3: Monetization
- Sell existing systems (voice agents, automations)
- Consulting for implementation
- Premium community access

## Content Pillars

1. **Current AI is broken** - Why prompting isn't enough
2. **The future is autonomous** - Multi-agent systems
