# CLASS 1: AI Fundamentals — What It Actually Is
## "Stop Using AI Like a Magic 8-Ball"

**Duration:** 75 minutes
**Goal:** Demystify AI, teach proper prompting, introduce meta-prompting

---

### OPENING (5 min)
**[SLIDE: "You're Not Dumb. AI Is Just Poorly Explained."]**

**Talking Points:**
- "If you've tried ChatGPT and thought 'this is useless' — you're not alone"
- "The problem isn't you. The problem is nobody taught you how to actually use it"
- "Today we fix that. By the end of this hour, you'll understand AI better than 95% of people who use it daily"

**Hook:** "I'm going to show you how to get 10x better results from AI in the next 15 minutes"

---

### SEGMENT 1: What AI Actually Is (15 min)
**[SLIDE: "AI = Very Fancy Autocomplete"]**

**Key Points:**

1. **It's not magic, it's statistics**
   - "AI has read basically the entire internet"
   - "When you ask it something, it's predicting the most likely next word"
   - "Like autocomplete on your phone, but on steroids"

2. **It doesn't "know" things — it predicts patterns**
   - Demo: Ask ChatGPT "What's 2+2?" vs "What's 847 x 923?"
   - "It's not calculating — it's pattern matching"
   - "This is why it can be confidently wrong"

3. **Implications for you:**
   - "It's excellent at things humans have written a lot about"
   - "It struggles with niche/specific stuff without guidance"
   - "The quality of your output = quality of your input"

**[SLIDE: "Garbage In = Garbage Out" with visual of prompt → AI → output]**

**Live Demo (3 min):**
- Type: "Write me a marketing email"
- Show the generic, useless result
- "This is how most people use AI. This is why most people think AI is useless."

---

### SEGMENT 2: Why Most People Use AI Wrong (15 min)
**[SLIDE: "The 3 Deadly Sins of AI Prompting"]**

**Sin #1: Being Too Vague**
- Bad: "Help me with marketing"
- Better: "Write a 200-word email to past customers announcing our summer sale, 20% off all services, casual tone"

**Sin #2: Wrong Expectations**
- "AI isn't going to run your business for you"
- "Think of it as a very smart intern who knows everything but needs specific instructions"
- "You're the expert. AI is the assistant."

**Sin #3: Not Iterating**
- "First response is almost never the final answer"
- "AI is a conversation, not a vending machine"
- "Ask follow-ups: 'Make it shorter' / 'More professional' / 'Add urgency'"

**[SLIDE: Simple visual showing iterative prompting conversation]**

**Live Demo (5 min):**
Same marketing email, but properly prompted:
- Add context: "I run a [type] business..."
- Add specifics: "The email should be..."
- Add constraints: "Keep it under 150 words..."
- Iterate: "Good, but make the CTA stronger"

Show the dramatic difference in quality.

---

### SEGMENT 3: The Meta-Prompt Technique (20 min)
**[SLIDE: "The Cheat Code: Use AI to Prompt AI"]**

**The Big Idea:**
- "You don't need to be a prompt expert"
- "AI knows how to write perfect prompts — just ask it"
- "This is called meta-prompting"

**The Formula:**
```
"I want to [GOAL]. What information would you need from me 
to give me the best possible response? Ask me clarifying 
questions before you start."
```

**Live Demo (10 min):**

1. **Start with vague request:**
   "I want to improve my customer service"

2. **Apply meta-prompt:**
   "I want to improve my customer service responses. What information would you need from me to help? Ask me 5-10 clarifying questions before giving advice."

3. **Watch AI ask smart questions:**
   - What industry?
   - What channels (phone, email, chat)?
   - What are common complaints?
   - What's your current response time?
   - etc.

4. **Answer the questions**

5. **Get dramatically better output**

**[SLIDE: Side-by-side comparison of outputs]**

**Advanced Meta-Prompt (The Prompt Generator):**
```
"You are a prompt engineering expert. I want to accomplish 
[GOAL]. Write me a detailed prompt I can use with ChatGPT 
to get the best results. Include:
- Role for the AI to play
- Context it needs
- Specific instructions
- Output format
- Any constraints"
```

**Live Demo (5 min):**
- Show generating a prompt for "write weekly employee updates"
- Copy the generated prompt
- Use it in a new chat
- Show the quality difference

---

### SEGMENT 4: Practical Framework (10 min)
**[SLIDE: "The RICE Framework for AI Prompts"]**

**R - Role**
"You are a [expert type] with [X years] experience in [field]..."

**I - Information**
"Here's the context: [background, situation, constraints]..."

**C - Command**
"I need you to [specific action with specific output]..."

**E - Example**
"Here's an example of what good looks like: [sample]..."

**Quick Reference Card:**
```
ROLE: "You are a [job title/expert] who specializes in [niche]"
INFO: "My business is [description]. The situation is [context]."
COMMAND: "Create/Write/Analyze [specific thing] that [criteria]"
EXAMPLE: "It should look something like: [example]"
```

**[SLIDE: RICE framework visual with examples]**

---

### SEGMENT 5: Live Q&A + Wrap-Up (10 min)

**Recap:**
- AI is pattern prediction, not magic
- Specific prompts = specific results
- Use meta-prompting to write better prompts
- RICE framework: Role, Information, Command, Example

**Teaser for Next Week:**
"Next week, we're going to BUILD something. A chatbot that actually does ONE thing really well for your business. Not a toy — a tool."

---

### HOMEWORK

**Assignment: Meta-Prompt Challenge**

1. Pick ONE business problem you'd normally ask an employee or Google:
   - "How do I handle [specific customer complaint]?"
   - "What should I include in [type of document]?"
   - "How do I [business task]?"

2. First, ask AI directly (the old way). Screenshot the result.

3. Then use the meta-prompt technique:
   - Ask AI to ask YOU clarifying questions first
   - Answer them
   - Get the improved response
   - Screenshot that result

4. **Bring both screenshots to Class 2** — we'll review some live

**Bonus:** Try the RICE framework on one prompt and see the difference

# CLASS 2: Building Single-Use-Case Chatbots
## "One Bot, One Job, Done Right"

**Duration:** 80 minutes
**Goal:** Build a functional specialized chatbot from scratch

---

### OPENING (5 min)
**[SLIDE: "Why Your Chatbot Sucks (And How to Fix It)"]**

**Homework Review (quick):**
- "Who tried the meta-prompt technique?"
- Show 1-2 submitted examples if available
- "See the difference? That's what we're building on today."

**Today's Promise:**
"By the end of this class, you'll have a working chatbot that handles ONE thing in your business — and does it better than you do."

---

### SEGMENT 1: Why General Chatbots Fail (10 min)
**[SLIDE: "Jack of All Trades = Master of None"]**

**The Problem with "General" AI:**
- "When you try to make AI do everything, it does nothing well"
- "It's like hiring one employee to be your accountant, lawyer, salesperson, and janitor"
- Example: "Ask ChatGPT 'help me with my business' — useless"

**The Solution: Specialization**
- "The best AI tools do ONE thing extraordinarily well"
- "Your customer service bot shouldn't also write blog posts"
- "Pick a specific task. Dominate it."

**Real Examples:**
- ❌ "Customer service chatbot" (too broad)
- ✅ "Chatbot that answers shipping status questions" (specific)
- ❌ "Sales assistant" (too broad)
- ✅ "Bot that qualifies leads by asking 5 questions" (specific)

**[SLIDE: Broad vs Specific comparison with checkmarks/X's]**

---

### SEGMENT 2: The System Prompt Foundation (15 min)
**[SLIDE: "The System Prompt = Your Bot's DNA"]**

**What is a System Prompt?**
- "Instructions that run BEFORE the user says anything"
- "It's like the training manual for a new employee"
- "The user never sees it, but it controls everything"

**Anatomy of a Great System Prompt:**

```
ROLE: Who the bot IS
├── Name, personality, expertise
├── What it knows / doesn't know
└── Tone and communication style

TASK: What the bot DOES
├── Primary function
├── Step-by-step process
└── Decision trees

RULES: What the bot WON'T do
├── Boundaries and limitations
├── Escalation triggers
└── Safety guardrails

CONTEXT: What the bot NEEDS
├── Company information
├── Product/service details
└── FAQ knowledge base
```

**[SLIDE: System Prompt Anatomy diagram]**

**Google Deep Research Method:**

"Here's the cheat code: Use Google's AI to research best practices, then feed that to your system prompt."

**Live Demo (5 min):**
1. Go to Google AI Studio or ChatGPT
2. Prompt: "Research the best practices for customer service chatbots in [industry]. What questions do customers typically ask? What makes responses effective? Give me a comprehensive overview."
3. Use that research to inform the system prompt

---

### SEGMENT 3: XML System Prompts (15 min)
**[SLIDE: "XML: Making AI Actually Follow Instructions"]**

**Why XML Format?**
- "AI models are trained on structured data"
- "XML tags act like filing folders — keeps everything organized"
- "Dramatically improves instruction-following"

**Basic XML Structure:**
```xml
<system_prompt>
  <role>
    <name>ShipBot</name>
    <personality>Friendly, efficient, helpful</personality>
    <expertise>Shipping status and delivery questions</expertise>
  </role>
  
  <task>
    <primary_function>Answer shipping and delivery questions</primary_function>
    <process>
      <step>1. Greet customer warmly</step>
      <step>2. Ask for order number</step>
      <step>3. Look up status (simulate if needed)</step>
      <step>4. Provide clear update</step>
      <step>5. Ask if there's anything else</step>
    </process>
  </task>
  
  <rules>
    <do_not>Never discuss refunds (escalate to human)</do_not>
    <do_not>Never share customer data from other orders</do_not>
    <do_not>Never make promises about delivery dates</do_not>
    <escalate_when>Customer is angry or mentions legal action</escalate_when>
  </rules>
  
  <company_info>
    <name>Bob's Widgets</name>
    <shipping_policy>Ships within 2 business days</shipping_policy>
    <carriers>USPS, UPS, FedEx</carriers>
  </company_info>
</system_prompt>
```

**[SLIDE: XML example - maybe split across two slides for readability]**

**Live Demo: Generate XML with AI (5 min):**

Prompt:
```
"I need a system prompt for a customer service chatbot. 
My business is [describe]. The bot should ONLY handle 
[specific task]. Generate an XML-formatted system prompt 
with role, task, rules, and company context sections."
```

Show the output, explain the sections.

---

### SEGMENT 4: Chain-of-Thought Prompting (10 min)
**[SLIDE: "Make AI Show Its Work"]**

**The Problem:**
- AI often jumps to answers
- Misses important steps
- Makes mistakes it wouldn't make if it "thought it through"

**Chain-of-Thought = Force Step-by-Step Reasoning**

**Add to System Prompt:**
```xml
<reasoning_process>
  <instruction>Before responding to the user, work through 
  these steps internally:</instruction>
  <step>1. What is the user actually asking?</step>
  <step>2. Do I have the information to answer this?</step>
  <step>3. Is this within my allowed scope?</step>
  <step>4. What's the best way to phrase my response?</step>
  <step>5. Should I escalate this to a human?</step>
</reasoning_process>
```

**Live Demo (3 min):**
- Show bot WITH chain-of-thought handling an edge case
- Show same bot WITHOUT it handling same edge case
- Demonstrate the quality difference

---

### SEGMENT 5: Live Build (20 min)
**[SLIDE: "Let's Build This Thing"]**

**Scenario:** "Appointment Confirmation Bot for a Home Services Company"

**Step 1: Define the ONE job (2 min)**
- Confirm upcoming appointments
- Answer basic questions about what to expect
- Reschedule if needed (within limits)
- That's IT. Nothing else.

**Step 2: Use Deep Research (3 min)**
- Research common questions customers have before home service appointments
- Research best practices for appointment reminder bots
- Feed findings into prompt

**Step 3: Build XML System Prompt (10 min)**

  </task>
  
  <conversation_flow>
    <step>1. Greet by name if available</step>
    <step>2. State appointment date/time</step>
    <step>3. Ask to confirm or reschedule</step>
    <step>4. If confirming: explain what to expect</step>
    <step>5. If rescheduling: offer 3 alternate times</step>
    <step>6. Close with any prep instructions</step>
  </conversation_flow>
  
  <rules>
    <escalate>If customer mentions dissatisfaction with previous service</escalate>
    <escalate>If customer requests same-day/next-day reschedule</escalate>
    <escalate>If question is outside appointment scope</escalate>
  </rules>
  
  <chain_of_thought>
    Before each response, consider:
    - Is this about the appointment or something else?
    - Can I handle this or should I escalate?
    - What does the customer need to know next?
  </chain_of_thought>
  
  <company_context>
    <service_area>Metro area within 30 miles</service_area>
    <hours>Mon-Fri 8am-6pm, Sat 9am-2pm</hours>
    <what_to_expect>Technician will arrive in marked van, 
    will call 30 min before arrival, appointment takes 
    1-2 hours typically</what_to_expect>
    <prep_instructions>Please ensure access to the area 
    needing service, secure pets, adult 18+ must be present</prep_instructions>
  </company_context>
</system_prompt>
```

**Step 4: Test It (5 min)**
- Paste into ChatGPT or Claude
- Run through test conversations:
  - "Is my appointment still on for Tuesday?"
  - "I need to reschedule"
  - "How much will this cost?"
  - "Your guy did a terrible job last time"
- Show how it handles each appropriately

# CLASS 3: Vibecoding — Building Your Own Systems
## "Describe It. Build It. Ship It."

**Duration:** 85 minutes
**Goal:** Connect AI to real business systems using no-code tools

---

### OPENING (5 min)
**[SLIDE: "What If You Could Just... Describe What You Want?"]**

**Homework Review:**
- Quick shoutout to anyone who built a working bot
- "Who found edge cases that broke their bot?"
- "That's learning. That's how this works."

**Today's Promise:**
"By the end of today, you'll have built an automation that actually runs in your business. No coding required. Just describing what you want."

---

### SEGMENT 1: What is Vibecoding? (10 min)
**[SLIDE: "Vibecoding: The Death of 'I'm Not Technical'"]**

**Definition:**
- "Vibecoding = describing what you want, AI writes the implementation"
- "You speak business. AI translates to technology."
- "The vibe is: 'I want X to happen when Y' — and then it just... works"

**Why This Changes Everything:**
- "Used to be: Have an idea → Hire developer → Wait 6 months → $50K later"
- "Now: Have an idea → Describe it to AI → Working prototype in an afternoon"
- "You don't need to know HOW. You need to know WHAT."

**Real Examples:**
- "When a customer fills out my contact form, add them to my CRM and send a personalized email"
- "Every morning, pull yesterday's sales and send me a summary"
- "When someone books an appointment, create a Google Calendar event and send them a reminder text"

**[SLIDE: Old way vs New way comparison - timeline/cost visual]**

---

### SEGMENT 2: The No-Code Toolkit (15 min)
**[SLIDE: "Your New Best Friends: Make, Zapier, n8n"]**

**The Big Three:**

**Zapier (The Easy One)**
- Most user-friendly
- Best for simple A → B automations
- "If this, then that" logic
- ~$20-50/month for real usage
- Best for: Beginners, simple workflows

**Make (The Powerful One)**
- More complex workflows
- Visual flow builder
- Better for multi-step automations
- ~$10-30/month
- Best for: Intermediate, complex logic

**n8n (The Free One)**
- Self-hosted (free) or cloud ($20+/month)
- Most flexible
- Steeper learning curve
- Best for: Technical users, full control

**[SLIDE: Comparison table of the three tools]**

**How They All Work:**
```
TRIGGER → ACTION → ACTION → ACTION
   ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓
"When..."  "Do..."   "Then..."  "Finally..."
```

**Example:**
```
[New email arrives] → [AI reads it] → [Categorizes it] → [Routes to right person]
     TRIGGER            ACTION 1         ACTION 2            ACTION 3
```

**[SLIDE: Trigger → Action flow visual]**

**Live Demo: Zapier Walkthrough (5 min)**
- Show the interface
- Show trigger library (email, forms, calendars, etc.)
- Show action library (spreadsheets, CRM, notifications)
- "This is your LEGO set. Triggers and actions are the bricks."

---

### SEGMENT 3: APIs for Normal People (10 min)
**[SLIDE: "APIs: How Apps Talk to Each Other"]**

**What's an API?**
- "Application Programming Interface"
- "In normal words: the official way apps share data"
- "Like a waiter at a restaurant: you tell them what you want, they bring it from the kitchen"

**Why You Care:**
- "APIs let you connect things that weren't designed to work together"
- "Your calendar + your email + your spreadsheet + your AI = automated system"
- "No-code tools handle the API stuff for you"

**The Basics (without getting nerdy):**
- APIs use "keys" (like passwords) to verify it's you
- Data goes back and forth as text (JSON)
- You don't need to understand the format — tools handle it

**[SLIDE: Simple API diagram - You → No-Code Tool → API → App]**

**Common APIs You'll Use:**
- Google Sheets (read/write spreadsheet data)
- Gmail (send/read emails)
- Google Calendar (create/read events)
- OpenAI/Claude (AI processing)
- Twilio (send SMS)
- Slack/Discord (send messages)
- Stripe (payment info)
- Your CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)

---

### SEGMENT 4: Live Build — Email to Spreadsheet to Notification (25 min)
**[SLIDE: "Let's Build: The Lead Capture System"]**

**The Scenario:**
"You get leads from a contact form. Currently, someone manually copies info to a spreadsheet, writes a response, and tries to remember to follow up. Let's automate all of it."

**What We're Building:**
```
[Form submitted] 
    → [Add to Google Sheet] 
    → [AI writes personalized response] 
    → [Send email to lead] 
    → [Notify you on phone]
    → [Schedule follow-up task]
```

**Step 1: Set Up the Trigger (3 min)**
- Connect form tool (Google Forms, Typeform, etc.)
- Show available data: name, email, message, etc.

**Step 2: Add to Spreadsheet (3 min)**
- Connect Google Sheets
- Map fields to columns
- Show data flowing in

**Step 3: AI Processing (10 min)**

This is where it gets interesting.

**Connect OpenAI/Claude:**
- Add API key (show where to get it)
- Set up the prompt

**The Prompt:**
```
You are a sales assistant for [Company Name]. A potential 
customer just submitted a contact form. 

Their info:
- Name: {{name}}
- Email: {{email}}
- Message: {{message}}

Write a personalized response that:
1. Thanks them by name
2. Addresses their specific question/need
3. Offers a clear next step (book a call, etc.)
4. Sounds human, not robotic
5. Is under 150 words

Sign off as [Your Name], [Your Title]
```

**Show the AI response** in the workflow
- "See how it uses their actual message to customize?"

**Step 4: Send the Email (3 min)**
- Connect Gmail
- Use AI output as email body
- Set subject line

**Step 5: Notify Yourself (3 min)**
- Add Slack notification or SMS
- "New lead: {{name}} - {{message}}"

**Step 6: Test It (3 min)**
- Submit a test form
- Watch the whole automation run
- Check each step worked

**[SLIDE: Final automation flow diagram]**

---

### SEGMENT 5: The Art of Describing Systems (10 min)
**[SLIDE: "How to Talk to AI About Automation"]**

**The Vibecoding Workflow:**

1. **Describe what you want in plain English:**
   "I want to automatically respond to customer reviews on Google. Good reviews get a thank you. Bad reviews get an apology and escalate to me."

2. **Ask AI to break it down:**
   "What steps would be needed to automate this? What tools would I need? What are potential failure points?"

3. **Ask AI to write the implementation:**
   "Write me a Make.com workflow that does this. Explain each step."

4. **Build it, test it, iterate**

**Live Demo (5 min):**
Prompt:
```
"I run a dental practice. I want to automate appointment 
reminders. When an appointment is 24 hours away, send 
the patient a text reminder. If they reply 'cancel', 
remove the appointment and notify my front desk.

Break this down into steps and tell me what tools I need."
```

Show AI response, discuss implementation

**Key Principle:**
"Start with WHAT you want. AI helps with HOW."

---

### WRAP-UP (10 min)

**Recap:**
- Vibecoding = describe what you want, build without coding
- No-code tools (Make, Zapier, n8n) connect everything
- APIs are just how apps talk — tools handle the complexity
- AI can help design AND execute automations

**[SLIDE: "The New Workflow" - Idea → Describe → AI Design → No-Code Build → Test → Deploy]**

**What You Can Now Do:**
- Automate repetitive data entry
- Create smart email responses
- Build notification systems
- Connect your tools together
- Have AI process information automatically

**Teaser for Class 4:**
"Next week, we go full science fiction. Voice agents that answer your phone. AI that works while you sleep. This is where it gets really interesting."

---

### HOMEWORK

**Assignment: Identify Your Automation Opportunities**

**Part 1: The Audit (30 min)**
List every repetitive task you or your team does:
- What triggers it? (email arrives, form submitted, time of day)
- What's the action? (add to spreadsheet, send email, create task)
- How often? (daily, weekly, every time X happens)
- How long does it take? (5 min, 30 min, etc.)

**Part 2: The Opportunity List**
Pick your TOP 3 automation candidates:
- Highest frequency tasks
- Simplest logic (clear if/then)
- Biggest time savings

**Part 3: Design One (Optional)**
Using what you learned:
1. Describe the automation in plain English

# CLASS 4: The Future — Voice & Autonomous Agents
## "AI That Works While You Sleep"

**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Goal:** Showcase advanced AI capabilities, soft-sell OttoGen services

---

### OPENING (5 min)
**[SLIDE: "Everything You've Learned Was Just the Beginning"]**

**Quick Celebration:**
- "Look what you've accomplished in 3 weeks"
- "You understand AI better than most tech workers"
- "You've built chatbots and automations"
- "Today we look at where this is all going — and how to get there first"

**Today's Agenda:**
- Why voice is the future
- Live voice agent demo
- Autonomous agents explained
- What's coming in 12-24 months
- How to implement this in YOUR business

---

### SEGMENT 1: Why Voice is Eating the World (15 min)
**[SLIDE: "Keyboards Are Dying"]**

**The Shift:**
- "Think about how your kids/grandkids use technology"
- "They talk to Siri, Alexa, Google"
- "They send voice messages instead of texts"
- "Typing is becoming the exception, not the rule"

**Statistics (update with current data):**
- Voice search usage growth
- Voice commerce projections
- Percentage of homes with smart speakers

**Why Voice > Text for Business:**
1. **Accessibility** — Anyone can talk. Not everyone types well.
2. **Speed** — Speaking is 3x faster than typing
3. **Multitasking** — Talk while driving, cooking, working
4. **Natural** — It's how humans have communicated for 200,000 years

**[SLIDE: Voice vs Text comparison - speed, accessibility, natural]**

**The Business Opportunity:**
- "Most businesses: Make customers fill out forms, wait on hold, type emails"
- "Future businesses: Just talk to us. We'll handle it."
- "The companies that figure this out first win"

**Real Use Cases:**
- Customer calls, AI answers, handles 80% of inquiries
- Voice ordering ("I need to reorder my usual")
- Appointment booking by phone (no apps, no portals)
- Internal operations ("What's our inventory on product X?")

---

### SEGMENT 2: Live Voice Agent Demo (20 min)
**[SLIDE: "Let's Call Our AI"]**

**Setup:**
"I'm going to show you a voice agent handling a real call. Watch how it:
- Sounds natural (not robotic)
- Handles interruptions
- Manages the conversation
- Actually accomplishes something"

**Demo Option 1: Pre-recorded Demo**
Play recording of voice agent handling:
- Customer calling to check appointment
- Customer asking for information
- Customer wanting to reschedule
- Edge case (angry customer / weird request)

**Demo Option 2: Live Call (Higher Impact)**
Actually call the voice agent live, have conversation
- Show it's not pre-recorded
- Test edge cases in real-time
- Let audience suggest questions

**[Talking through the demo:]**
- "Notice how it understood the question even with background noise"
- "See how it didn't just answer — it guided the conversation"
- "That pause? It's thinking about the best response"
- "Watch how it handles this interruption..."

**After Demo:**
"That call? Handled in 2 minutes. No human needed. 24/7. Never gets tired, never gets frustrated, never calls in sick."

**The Technology Stack:**
- Speech-to-Text (transcription)
- AI Processing (understanding + response)
- Text-to-Speech (voice generation)
- Telephony (phone integration)

**[SLIDE: Voice AI stack diagram]**

**What It Takes to Build This:**
- "This used to cost $500K+ and 18 months"
- "Now? A few thousand and a few weeks"
- "The technology is ready. Most businesses don't know."

---

### SEGMENT 3: Autonomous Agents — AI That Actually Does Things (20 min)
**[SLIDE: "Beyond Chatbots: AI That Takes Action"]**

**The Progression:**
1. **Chatbots** — AI that talks (Class 2)
2. **Automations** — Systems that connect (Class 3)
3. **Autonomous Agents** — AI that thinks AND acts independently

**What is an Autonomous Agent?**
- "AI that can work on complex tasks without step-by-step instructions"
- "It can plan, execute, adjust, and report back"
- "Like a really smart employee who you give a goal, and they figure out how"

**[SLIDE: Chatbot vs Automation vs Agent comparison]**

**Real Example: Research Agent**
"I tell it: 'Research our top 10 competitors and create a comparison matrix of their pricing, features, and reviews.'

It then:
1. Plans the research approach
2. Searches for competitors
3. Visits each website
4. Extracts relevant information
5. Compiles into a spreadsheet
6. Writes a summary analysis
7. Delivers the report

All while I do other things."

**Live Demo: Heartbeats and Planning**

"Let me show you an agent system in action."

**Show Clawdbot/OttoGen Agent:**
- "Heartbeats" — The agent checking in periodically
- Show it planning a task
- Show it executing steps
- Show it reporting results

**Narrate the Demo:**
- "See this? It's checking what needs to be done."
- "Now it's breaking the task into steps."
- "It's working through each step..."
- "Hit a problem? Watch it adjust."
- "Done. Here's the output."

**[SLIDE: Agent workflow - Plan → Execute → Monitor → Adjust → Complete]**

**What Agents Can Do Today:**
- Research and analysis
- Content creation at scale
- Data processing and cleanup
- System monitoring and alerts
- Customer outreach sequences
- Report generation
- Quality assurance

**What They Can't Do (Yet):**
- Physical world tasks
- Truly creative work (they augment, not replace)
- High-stakes decisions (they recommend, you decide)
- Tasks requiring real-time human judgment

---

### SEGMENT 4: What's Coming — 12-24 Month Outlook (10 min)
**[SLIDE: "The Next 24 Months Will Be Insane"]**

**Voice:**
- Near-perfect voice cloning (your voice, AI-powered)
- Real-time translation (speak English, customer hears Spanish)
- Emotional intelligence (AI that detects and responds to mood)
- Proactive voice (AI calls customers, not just answers)

**Agents:**
- Multi-agent systems (team of AIs working together)
- Physical world integration (robots, drones, IoT)
- True reasoning (not just pattern matching)
- Personalized AI employees (trained on YOUR business)

**Cost/Accessibility:**
- What costs $10K now will cost $1K
- What requires experts now will be drag-and-drop
- The gap between "can afford AI" and "can't" will disappear

**[SLIDE: Timeline visual of upcoming capabilities]**

**The Winners and Losers:**
- "Winners: Businesses that start experimenting NOW"
- "Losers: Businesses that wait until 'the technology is ready'"
- "The technology IS ready. The question is: are you?"

# AI for Business Owners Who Don't Have Time for BS
## A Free 4-Week Masterclass That Actually Teaches You Something

**Let's be honest:**

You've heard about ChatGPT. Maybe you've tried it. You typed something in, got some generic response, and thought "what's the big deal?"

You're not alone. And you're not dumb.

**The problem is nobody taught you how to actually use this stuff.**

Until now.

---

### What You'll Learn:

**Week 1: AI Fundamentals**
What AI actually is, why most people use it wrong, and the "meta-prompt" technique that gets you 10x better results immediately.

**Week 2: Building Chatbots**
Build a specialized bot that handles one thing in your business — better than a human would. No coding required.

**Week 3: Automation**
Connect your tools together. Email → Spreadsheet → AI → Notification. Systems that run while you sleep.

**Week 4: The Future**
Voice agents, autonomous AI, and what's coming in the next 12-24 months. (Spoiler: It's wild.)
