### B. Healthcare / Hospitals (New Target)

| Competitor | Origin | Product | Approx. Price | Healthcare Focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tovertafel (Tover)** | 🇳🇱 Netherlands | "Magic Table" ceiling projector | ~€8,000 + subscription (~€800/yr) | **Dominant in dementia/elderly care.** 4,000+ installations globally. Evidence-based. |
| **OMI (OmiVista Mobii)** | UK | Portable projector (floor/table/bed) | ~€9,000–€11,000 | Elderly care, rehab, sensory rooms. 150+ activities. NHS adopted. |
| **SensoryOne** | UK | Interactive projection rooms | Quote-based (€10,000–€25,000 est.) | Sensory rooms, hospitals, inclusive care |
| **GestureTek Health** | Canada | Gesture-controlled displays | Enterprise pricing | Wayfinding, patient info, touchless |
| **EyeClick (BEAM)** | US/Israel | BEAM (repurposed for healthcare) | €5,000–€13,000 | Pediatric waiting rooms, distraction therapy |
| **TouchWall** | US | Immersive wall projection | Quote-based | Children's hospitals, anxiety reduction |

**Typical deal size:** €8,000–€25,000 per unit/room; multi-room hospital deals can reach €50,000–€100,000+
**Market dynamics:** Higher margins, longer sales cycles, procurement processes. **Clinical evidence and hygiene compliance are table stakes.** Tovertafel (Dutch!) is the clear category leader for elderly care — IAM must differentiate or target underserved niches (rehab, pediatric wards, waiting rooms).

### C. Corporate Offices (New Target)

| Competitor | Origin | Product | Approx. Price | Corporate Focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Electrosonic** | UK/US | Custom projection solutions | €25,000–€200,000+ | Premium lobby/boardroom installations |

**Typical deal size:** €10,000–€50,000 for a single installation; flagship lobby projects €100,000+
**Market dynamics:** Bespoke, project-based. Buyers are facilities managers, workplace experience teams, or AV integrators. Long procurement but high lifetime value. Few dedicated "interactive floor for offices" players — most competitors are AV integrators or event companies repurposing tech.

## 2. Unique Value by Segment

### Healthcare Value Proposition
- **Rehabilitation:** Gamified movement therapy — patients engage naturally with projected games, improving adherence to rehab programs (gait, balance, cognitive)

- **Pediatric wards:** Distraction therapy during procedures, anxiety reduction, makes hospitals less scary
- **Waiting rooms:** Reduces perceived wait times, calms anxious patients/families
- **Hygiene:** Touchless interaction (motion/gesture) = infection control advantage over tablets/touchscreens

### Corporate Value Proposition
- **Lobby "wow factor":** Brand storytelling, visitor engagement, modern image projection

- **Meeting rooms:** Interactive presentations, collaborative brainstorming on projected surfaces
- **Talent attraction:** "Cool office" factor for recruiting, especially in creative/tech industries
- **Event spaces:** Adaptable for corporate events, product launches, client experiences

## 4. Positioning Recommendations

### For Healthcare: "Healing Through Play"
**Message:** *"Interactive projection that supports recovery, reduces anxiety, and brings joy — without anyone needing to touch a surface."*

- Lead with **clinical outcomes**: reduced agitation in elderly, improved rehab adherence, lower anxiety scores in pediatric patients
- Emphasize **hygiene** (touchless = infection control)
- Get **pilot studies** or case studies with 1-2 Dutch healthcare facilities
- Pursue **CE medical device** or similar certifications if possible
- **Pricing strategy:** Premium (€8,000–€15,000 per unit) — healthcare budgets support it and expect it
- **Key differentiator vs Tovertafel:** IAM offers floor AND wall projection (Tovertafel = table only), enabling full-room rehab experiences and more versatile installations
- **Sales channel:** Healthcare distributors, medical equipment catalogs, direct to facilities managers

### For Corporate: "Spaces That Move People"
**Message:** *"Transform any floor or wall into an interactive brand experience — for your team, your clients, and your culture."*

- Lead with **ROI on employee experience** and **brand impression** on visitors
- Emphasize **versatility**: same system works in lobby, break room, event space
- Create **"office edition" content packs**: branded welcome screens, wellness/movement games, meeting icebreakers
- **Pricing strategy:** Mid-premium (€8,000–€20,000 per installation), with recurring content subscription potential
- **Key differentiator:** Turnkey and affordable compared to Electrosonic/custom AV (which start at €25K+); more engaging than a flat screen
- **Sales channel:** AV integrators, workplace design firms, direct to workplace experience/facilities teams

### For Children (Sharpen Existing Position): "Play That Moves"
**Message:** *"The interactive playground that fits in any room."*

- Defend against Chinese low-cost entrants with **content quality**, **local Dutch/EU support**, and **ease of use**
- Consider **subscription model** for ongoing revenue (content updates, new games)
- **Pricing strategy:** Stay competitive at €4,000–€10,000; offer bundles

## 5. Strategic Priorities

1. **Healthcare is the highest-margin, most defensible opportunity.** Tovertafel proved Dutch-origin interactive projection can win globally in care. IAM's floor/wall capability is a natural differentiator (whole-body movement vs. tabletop hand gestures). Prioritize this.

2. **Corporate is high-value but bespoke.** Start with 2-3 showcase installations (ideally Dutch tech companies or co-working spaces) to build a portfolio. Partner with AV integrators rather than selling direct.

3. **Children's market is the cash cow.** Don't neglect it — use it to fund healthcare/corporate expansion. Tighten the subscription/content model for recurring revenue.

4. **Build a case study library.** Each new segment needs 3-5 reference cases before scaling. Offer pilot pricing to early adopters in exchange for testimonials and data.

5. **Localize the advantage.** IAM is Dutch. Tovertafel is Dutch. The Netherlands has a strong reputation in healthcare innovation. Use "Dutch design + Dutch healthcare expertise" as a credibility anchor internationally.
