# OttoGen Content Distribution Strategy
**Version 1.0 — February 2026**
**For Otto (Oopuo) — Personal Brand + AI Empire**

---

## 1. Brand Architecture

```
                    OTTO (Personal Brand)
                    "OttoGen" identity
                    Face, voice, philosophy
                          │
                      ┌───┴───┐
                      │ OOPUO │  ← Holding / umbrella (rarely public-facing)
                      └───┬───┘
          ┌───────┬───────┼───────┬──────────┬──────────┐
        Kira  ZenithCred  IAM  SentinAgro  CuttingEdge  Abura
```

**The Rule:** Otto is always the main character. Companies are *proof points*, not separate brands. You don't promote ZenithCred — you show Otto building ZenithCred and let people see what's possible.

**Naming convention on socials:**
- Main accounts: **OttoGen** (this is the brand people follow)
- Product accounts: Only create when a product has paying users. Until then, everything funnels through OttoGen.
- Never split attention across 6 brand accounts with zero audience. One megaphone, not six whispers.

**How to reference companies in content:**
- "I'm building 6 AI companies simultaneously. Here's what happened today in the cattle drone one." — casual, part of the story
- Never corporate. Never "ZenithCred™ is proud to announce." You're 20, not a press release.

**Comparable:** How Elon references Tesla/SpaceX/Boring Co. — they're chapters of *his* story, not separate narratives.

---

## 2. Platform Strategy

### PRIMARY — Where you build your empire

**YouTube (Long-form + Shorts)**
- **Why:** Evergreen discovery engine. GenX business owners *search* YouTube for "how to use AI in my business." This is where you catch them. Shorts feed TikTok-style discovery without needing a separate account.
- **Audience:** All three targets. GenX finds long-form. GenZ finds Shorts. Tech-adjacent finds both.
- **Effort:** 2 long-form videos/week + 5 Shorts/week (Shorts are clips from long-form + standalone)
- **Priority:** This is your #1 platform. Non-negotiable.

**Twitter/X**
- **Why:** AI Twitter is the most concentrated pool of tech-adjacent people, VCs, and founders. This is where deals happen, not views. One viral thread can put you in rooms that take years otherwise.
- **Audience:** Tertiary (tech-adjacent) + investors + potential collaborators
- **Effort:** 3-5 tweets/day + 1 thread/week. Low production cost, high leverage.
- **Priority:** Your daily conversation layer. Think out loud here.

### SECONDARY — Growth accelerators

**TikTok**
- **Why:** GenZ lives here. This is where "Otto as aspirational figure" gets built. Algorithm is brutal but fair — zero followers can get 1M views if the content hits.
- **Audience:** Secondary (GenZ)
- **Effort:** 5 videos/week (repurposed Shorts + TikTok-native content)
- **Note:** Don't overthink production. Raw, direct-to-camera, 30-90 seconds. The Swiss Cyberpunk aesthetic actually pops here.

**LinkedIn**
- **Why:** GenX business owners scroll LinkedIn daily. "AI is coming for your business" content *converts* here because the audience is already in business mode. This is your client acquisition channel.
- **Audience:** Primary (GenX business owners)
- **Effort:** 3-4 posts/week. Text posts with occasional video. Repurpose Twitter threads with a professional angle.
- **Note:** LinkedIn's algorithm massively favors native video right now. A 20-year-old showing real AI dashboards will stop the scroll.

### TERTIARY — Presence, not priority

**Instagram Reels**
- **Why:** Brand credibility + lifestyle layer. When someone Googles you, a polished Instagram presence says "this person is real." Reels algorithm can surprise you.
- **Audience:** Mix of GenZ + general discovery
- **Effort:** 3 Reels/week (repurposed TikToks/Shorts). Stories for behind-the-scenes.
- **Approach:** Curate the Swiss Cyberpunk aesthetic. This is your visual portfolio.

**Twitch**
- **Why:** You mentioned daily streaming. This is high-risk, high-reward. The upside: a devoted community that watches you build in real-time. The downside: it eats hours and the audience doesn't transfer easily to other platforms.
- **Audience:** Secondary (GenZ) + niche tech audience
- **Effort:** 2-3 streams/week, 2-3 hours each. NOT daily — that's a burnout trap at this stage.
- **Approach:** "Build with me" sessions. Screen share + face cam. Let people watch you operate Kira, manage companies, solve problems live. Clip the best moments for YouTube/TikTok.
- **When to scale up:** Once you hit 50 average concurrent viewers, consider increasing frequency.

### Platform Priority Stack (time allocation)

| Platform | Weekly Hours | Content Pieces/Week |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| YouTube | 8h (filming + editing) | 2 long-form + 5 Shorts |
| Twitter/X | 3h (throughout the day) | 20-25 tweets + 1 thread |
| TikTok | 1h (repurpose + native) | 5 videos |
| LinkedIn | 2h | 3-4 posts |
| Instagram | 0.5h (repurpose) | 3 Reels + Stories |
| Twitch | 6h (2-3 streams) | 2-3 streams |
| **Total** | **~20h/week** | |

This is aggressive but doable with AI assistance handling editing, scheduling, and repurposing.

## 3. Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: "The Post-Labour Manifesto" (Philosophy + Vision)
**Format:** 8-15 min YouTube videos, direct-to-camera or walking/talking
**Frequency:** 1/week
**Tone:** Philosophical, provocative, future-forward. This is your signature.

**Series concept:** Each episode tackles one aspect of the world after AI makes traditional labour obsolete. Not dystopian fear-mongering. Not blind techno-optimism. The raw, honest middle ground from someone actually building this future.

**Episode ideas:**
1. "Why Your Job Title Won't Exist in 5 Years (And Why That's Fine)"
2. "I Run 6 Companies Alone. Here's What 'Work' Actually Means Now"
3. "The Last Generation That Needs to Apply for Jobs"
4. "Why I Dropped Everything at 18 to Build AI (Not Crypto, Not Dropshipping)"
5. "What Happens When Everyone Has an AI Employee?"
6. "The Loneliness of Building the Future Nobody Understands Yet"
7. "Post-Labour Relationships: When Neither Person Needs to Work"
8. "Why GenX Business Owners Should Be Terrified (And What to Do About It)"

**Repurpose:** Each video → 3-4 Shorts/TikToks (best quotes/moments) → 1 Twitter thread → 1 LinkedIn post

### Pillar 2: "Building in Public: 6 Companies, 1 Person" (Demos + Process)
**Format:** 5-12 min YouTube videos, screen recordings + face cam
**Frequency:** 1/week
**Tone:** Practical, show-don't-tell, transparent

**Series concept:** Each week, show what actually happened across your companies. Real dashboards. Real numbers. Real problems. The knowledge graph. Kira doing actual work. Not a highlight reel — the messy reality of running an AI-powered empire.

**Episode ideas:**
1. "My AI Assistant Managed My Calendar for a Week. Here's What Happened"
2. "Inside My Knowledge Graph: 10,000 Entities Running My Business"
3. "I Let AI Write Every Email This Week. The Results Were..."
4. "Building a Drone Cattle Monitoring System from My Bedroom"
5. "How I Project-Manage 6 Companies Without a Single Employee"
6. "My AI Found a $40K Mistake I Almost Missed"
7. "What My Dashboard Looks Like at 3AM When Everything's Breaking"
8. "Teaching AI to Design Children's Projectors (IAM Build Log)"

**Repurpose:** Best demo clips → Shorts/TikToks. Technical insights → Twitter threads. Business lessons → LinkedIn.

### Pillar 3: "AI for Normies" (Education for GenX)
**Format:** 3-7 min YouTube videos, screen share with clear explanations
**Frequency:** 1 every 2 weeks (alternates with Pillar 1 or 2 for your 2nd weekly video)
**Tone:** Patient, no jargon, "let me show you" energy

**Series concept:** Demystify AI for people who aren't technical. These are your client magnets. GenX business owners watch these, realize they need this, and DM you.

**Episode ideas:**
1. "AI in 2026: What You Actually Need to Know (Skip the Hype)"
2. "I Replaced 3 Roles in My Company with AI. Here's How."
3. "The $500/Month AI Setup That Replaces a $5K/Month Employee"
4. "Your Business Has Data. Here's Why You're Wasting It."
5. "AI Isn't Going to Take Your Job. It's Going to Take Your Competitor's."
6. "Set Up Your First AI Workflow in 30 Minutes (I'll Show You)"

**Repurpose:** These are evergreen. One good video here can generate leads for months. Clip the "aha moment" sections for Shorts. Share results/stats on LinkedIn.

### Pillar 4: "The OttoGen Life" (Lifestyle + Culture)
**Format:** Short-form only (Shorts, TikToks, Reels, Stories) + Twitch streams
**Frequency:** 2-3 pieces/week
**Tone:** Raw, energetic, aspirational. Swiss Cyberpunk aesthetic.

**Content ideas:**
- Day-in-the-life: waking up, checking dashboards, managing companies
- Setup tours, desk tours, screen tours
- Netherlands vlog moments while talking about AI/future
- Reacting to AI news in real-time
- "Things I learned this week building AI companies"
- Behind-the-scenes of recording other content
- Hot takes on tech news (30 seconds, direct to camera)
- Visiting interesting places/people (when you travel)

**This pillar builds the *person*, not the expert.** People follow people, not topics.

## 5. Content Production Pipeline

### Minimal Gear (Start Here)
- **Camera:** iPhone 15/16 (you probably already have this). It's good enough. Period.
- **Microphone:** Rode Wireless GO II — €299. Clips to your shirt. This is the ONE investment that matters. Bad audio kills videos faster than bad video.
- **Lighting:** One ring light or one LED panel — €50-80. Put it behind your phone/camera.
- **Tripod:** Any phone tripod with adjustable height — €30.
- **Screen recording:** OBS (free) for desktop captures, Twitch streams, and demo recordings.
- **Background:** Your actual desk/setup. The Swiss Cyberpunk aesthetic works if you have good lighting. Add an LED strip (€20) for accent color.

**Total startup cost: ~€400.** Don't buy more until you've posted 30 videos.

### AI-Assisted Editing Workflow

```
RAW FOOTAGE (phone/OBS)
        │
        ▼
AUTOMATIC ROUGH CUT (Opus Clip / CapCut AI / Descript)
  - AI identifies highlights
  - Auto-captions generated
  - Silence/dead air removed
        │
        ▼
KIRA: Script + Metadata
  - Generate title options (5 per video, pick best)
  - Write description + tags
  - Create thumbnail text/concept
  - Schedule across platforms
        │
        ▼
QUICK MANUAL REVIEW (15-20 min per video)
  - Watch at 2x, fix any AI editing mistakes
  - Approve thumbnail
  - Adjust captions if needed
        │
        ▼
PUBLISH + REPURPOSE
  - Long-form → YouTube
  - AI extracts 3-5 best clips → Shorts/TikTok/Reels
  - Key quotes → Twitter thread
  - Business insight → LinkedIn post
```

### Recommended Editing Tools
| Tool | Use | Cost |
|------|-----|------|
| **Descript** | Long-form editing (text-based, remove filler words) | €24/mo |
| **Opus Clip** | Auto-generate Shorts from long-form | €15/mo |
| **CapCut** | Quick edits, captions, effects for short-form | Free |
| **Canva** | Thumbnails, LinkedIn graphics | Free tier |
| **OBS** | Screen recording, Twitch streaming | Free |
| **Buffer or Hypefury** | Social scheduling (Twitter + LinkedIn) | €15-30/mo |

**Monthly tool cost: ~€70-85.** This replaces what would be a €2-3K/month editor.

### How Kira Fits Into Production

Kira should handle the repetitive cognitive work:

1. **Pre-production:** Otto logs a voice note or text dump about what he worked on today. Kira converts it into a script outline with hook, key points, and CTA.
2. **Metadata:** Kira generates 5 title options (optimized for CTR), descriptions with keywords, and tag sets for each video.
3. **Thumbnail concepts:** Kira describes 3 thumbnail concepts per video (text overlay, expression suggestion, color scheme). Otto picks one, generates in Canva or AI image tool.
4. **Scheduling:** Kira maintains the content calendar and sends reminders: "Film Pillar 2 video today. Topic: Knowledge Graph walkthrough. Outline ready."
5. **Repurposing:** After a long-form video is published, Kira identifies the 4 best clip timestamps and generates captions/hooks for each platform.
6. **Analytics:** Weekly report — what performed, what didn't, suggested adjustments.

### Batch Recording Strategy

**Film 2 long-form videos in one session.** Change your shirt between takes so they look like different days. This buys you flexibility.

**Batch short-form:** Set aside 1 hour to record 5-8 short pieces back-to-back. Write bullet points for each (not full scripts). Direct to camera, 30-90 seconds each. This covers your Shorts/TikToks for the week.

**Screen recordings:** Whenever you're doing interesting work in Kira or your dashboard, hit record. You'll build a library of demo footage to cut from later.

## 6. Growth Tactics — First 90 Days

### Comparable Creators (Zero to Known)

- **Pieter Levels (@levelsio):** Built in public on Twitter. Went from nobody to one of the most followed indie hackers by showing real revenue numbers, real products, no filter. Study his tweet style.
- **Iman Gadzhi:** Started YouTube at 17, built a personal brand around agency/business education. Went from 0 to 1M+ subscribers by being direct, showing results, and targeting a clear audience (young entrepreneurs).
- **Theo (t3.gg):** Went from unknown developer to 200K+ YouTube subscribers by having strong opinions and shipping content consistently. His "just talk to the camera" format is exactly what you should do.
- **Sam Sulek:** Blew up on YouTube/TikTok with zero editing, zero production value — just raw, authentic, long-form content. Proof that consistency + authenticity > production quality.

### Week 1-4: Foundation

**Goal:** Establish presence, publish first 10 videos, find your voice.

**Actions:**
- Set up all accounts with consistent branding (OttoGen, Swiss Cyberpunk aesthetic, same bio structure)
- Publish first 10 videos (see Section 9)
- Post on Twitter 3-5x/day — hot takes on AI news, observations from building
- Comment on 20 relevant YouTube videos/day (genuine comments, not spam)
- Engage in 5 AI Twitter Spaces per week (just listen + drop a smart comment)
- Follow and engage with 50 relevant accounts on each platform
- DM 10 creators in your space per week — not pitching, just connecting

**Targets (realistic for zero-audience start):**
- YouTube: 100-300 subscribers, 1K-5K total views
- Twitter: 200-500 followers
- TikTok: 500-2K followers (if one video pops, could be 10K+)
- LinkedIn: 100-300 connections

**Content focus:** Lead with your most visually impressive stuff. The knowledge graph. The dashboard. The "I run 6 companies from my bedroom" hook. First impressions matter.

### Week 5-8: Acceleration

**Goal:** Double down on what's working, start collaborations, build email list.

**Actions:**
- Analyze Week 1-4 analytics. Which videos got the most views? Which tweets popped? Do more of that.
- Launch a simple landing page: ottogen.ai (or similar). Email capture: "Get my weekly AI insights." Use ConvertKit (free tier).
- Start 1 collaboration per week: podcast appearances, Twitter Spaces co-hosting, YouTube collabs with creators in 1-10K range
- Cross-post best-performing content to subreddits: r/artificial, r/entrepreneur, r/startups (add value, don't spam)
- Start the Twitch streams (you now have a small audience to notify)
- Run one "challenge" or "experiment" that's shareable: "I'm letting AI run my companies for 48 hours" — document everything

**Targets:**
- YouTube: 500-1K subscribers, 10K-30K total views
- Twitter: 1K-2K followers
- TikTok: 2K-10K followers
- LinkedIn: 500+ connections
- Email list: 100-300 subscribers

**Community building (GenZ):**
- Launch a Discord server. Don't overproduce it — 5 channels max: general, ai-chat, otto-updates, build-in-public, memes.
- Promote it in every video: "Link to the Discord in description."
- Be active in it daily for 15 minutes. Answer questions. Post updates others don't see.
- Goal: 100 active members by Week 8.

### Week 9-12: Monetization

**Goal:** First paying client, first revenue from content, prove the model.

**Actions:**
- Create a "Work with Otto" page on your website. Simple: "I help businesses implement AI. Here's what I've built. Book a call."
- LinkedIn outreach: Post a case study (even if it's your own companies). "How I saved 40 hours/week with AI automation." Include a CTA.
- Launch a free AI audit offer: "I'll look at your business for 30 minutes and tell you where AI can save you money." Record these (with permission) for content.
- Price your AI consulting: Start at €2,500-5,000 for a project. You're cheap for GenX business owners used to paying agencies €10K+.
- Pitch 3 podcasts in AI/business/entrepreneurship space per week
- Consider a paid community tier on Discord (€10-20/month) for GenZ — exclusive content, early access, direct access to you

**Targets:**
- YouTube: 1K-3K subscribers (aim for monetization threshold)
- Twitter: 3K-5K followers
- TikTok: 5K-20K followers
- Email list: 500-1K subscribers
- Revenue: 1-3 consulting clients (€5K-15K)
- Discord: 200-500 members

## 9. First 10 Videos

These are designed to film THIS WEEK with what Otto already has: a phone, his computer, his dashboard, his companies, and his face.

### Video 1: "I'm 20 and I Run 6 AI Companies. Alone."
**Format:** 8-10 min, direct to camera + screen recordings
**Description:** The origin story. Who you are, what you've built, why you're doing this. Walk through each company in 60 seconds. Show the dashboard. End with: "Follow along — I'm documenting everything."
**This is your trailer. Pin it on every platform.**

### Video 2: "My AI Assistant Runs My Life (I'll Show You)"
**Format:** 7-10 min, screen share + face cam
**Description:** Full demo of Kira. Show the knowledge graph, the NLP pipeline, how it manages your projects. Let people see the actual interface. This is your "holy shit" moment for viewers.

### Video 3: "The Post-Labour Manifesto: Why Jobs Are Already Dead"
**Format:** 8-12 min, direct to camera (walking or sitting)
**Description:** Your philosophical thesis. The world is changing. Traditional careers are a trap. You're building the alternative. This positions you as a thinker, not just a builder.

### Video 4: "How I'd Use AI to 10x Any Small Business (Free Breakdown)"
**Format:** 6-8 min, screen share
**Description:** Pick a hypothetical (or real) small business. Walk through exactly what AI tools you'd implement, what they'd save, what the ROI would be. This is your GenX client magnet.

### Video 5: "My $0 Setup That Manages 6 Companies" (Short-form, 90 seconds)
**Format:** Quick desk/setup tour
**Description:** Show your workspace, your screens, what's running. Keep it punchy. Swiss Cyberpunk aesthetic. "This room runs a drone company, a cosmetics brand, and an AI platform simultaneously."

### Video 6: "What No One Tells You About Building AI Products"

## 10. Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: Spreading Too Thin Across Platforms
**Probability: HIGH**
**Impact:** Mediocre content everywhere, great content nowhere. Burnout.
**Mitigation:**
- YouTube and Twitter are non-negotiable. Everything else is repurposing.
- If you're struggling in Week 3, drop Instagram and Twitch. Add them back later.
- The rule: if a platform isn't growing after 30 days of consistent posting, pause it for 2 months and revisit.

### Risk 2: Showing Too Much IP / Competitive Advantage
**Probability: MEDIUM**
**Impact:** Someone copies your architecture, tools, or approach.
**Mitigation:**
- Show WHAT your tools do, not HOW they're built. Demo the knowledge graph output, not the code.
- Never show API keys, proprietary algorithms, or client data (obviously).
- The real moat is execution speed + your personal brand, not the tech itself. By the time someone copies it, you're 6 months ahead.
- Rule of thumb: show anything you'd show in a sales demo. Hide anything you'd put in a patent application.

### Risk 3: Burnout From Daily Content
**Probability: HIGH**
**Impact:** You stop posting for 3 weeks, lose all momentum, feel like a failure.
**Mitigation:**
- Batch recording is non-negotiable. Film 2 weeks of content in 2 days.
- Build a 2-week content buffer before you start posting. If you get sick or burned out, you have runway.
- One rest day per week. No content, no posting, no "just one tweet." Your brain needs it.
- If you feel burnout coming: drop to 1 YouTube video/week and 3 tweets/day. That's your minimum viable output. Don't go to zero.

### Risk 4: The "All Talk No Product" Trap
**Probability: MEDIUM-HIGH**
**Impact:** People see you as a content creator cosplaying as a founder, not an actual builder.
**Mitigation:**
- Every piece of philosophical/lifestyle content must be balanced with a build-in-public piece showing real progress.
- Set a rule: never go more than 2 videos without showing something you BUILT or SHIPPED.
- Share real metrics. Revenue, users, even if they're small. "$200 in revenue" is more credible than "revolutionizing the industry."
- Deadline pressure: announce things publicly, then you have to deliver. "Next month I'm launching Kira's beta. Follow along."

### Risk 5: Audience Mismatch
**Probability: MEDIUM**
**Impact:** You attract followers who watch but never buy. Vanity metrics.
**Mitigation:**
- Track not just views/followers, but email signups and DMs from business owners.
- If after 60 days you have 10K TikTok followers but zero consulting leads, your content mix is wrong — shift toward more "AI for Normies" and LinkedIn.
- The GenZ audience is long-term. The GenX audience pays the bills NOW. Prioritize accordingly in the first 6 months.

### Risk 6: Overcomplicating Production
**Probability: HIGH for perfectionists**
**Impact:** You spend 10 hours editing a video that gets 200 views.
**Mitigation:**
- Set a hard rule: no video takes more than 3 hours total (filming + editing). If it does, you're overproducing.
- Your first 50 videos will not be great. That's fine. Sam Sulek films with a GoPro in bad lighting and gets millions of views. Content > production.
- Ship fast. Learn fast. Improve incrementally.

### Risk 7: Platform Dependency
**Probability: LOW (short-term), HIGH (long-term)**
**Impact:** Algorithm changes tank your reach overnight.
**Mitigation:**
- Build an email list from Day 1. This is the only audience you truly own.
- Diversify across platforms (already planned).
- Drive all audiences to Discord + email as owned channels.
- Never build a business model that depends on one platform's algorithm.
