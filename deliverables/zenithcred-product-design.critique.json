    "score": 9,
    "feedback": "Covers all requested elements: vision, personas, features, workflows, UX screens, gamification, branding, architecture, MVP scope. Minor gap: no competitive landscape section, no pricing/business model, and no accessibility/ADA compliance considerations."

  "accuracy": {
    "score": 7,
    "feedback": "Most claims are reasonable. 'Corporate wellness budgets doubled since 2020' is unverified and likely exaggerated. HIPAA-aware with BAA available is a bold claim for a seed-stage startup — needs legal vetting. Muse 2 EEG providing reliable 'Brain Z-Scores' in a noisy gym environment is optimistic; Z-Scores typically require clinical-grade EEG. The 8-12 week MVP timeline is tight but not unreasonable if scoped correctly."

  "actionability": {
    "score": 8,
    "feedback": "MVP phasing is clear and realistic. Screen map gives enough detail to brief a designer. Architecture is implementable. Credit/token formulas are concrete. Missing: cost estimates for hardware BOM, development team size/roles needed, and specific vendor decisions (which edge device, which spirometer model). Otto could hand this to a product team tomorrow, but would need to fill in budget and resourcing."

  "quality": {
    "score": 9,
    "feedback": "Exceptionally well-structured. Clean formatting, logical flow, professional tone. No filler. Tables used effectively. The data flow diagram is clear. Tone of voice section is sharp. Only nitpick: document is long (~4500 words) — an executive summary at the top would help investors who skim."

  "overall_score": 8,
  "summary": "This is a strong, investor-ready product design document that covers the full product surface with impressive depth. The gamification system is well-thought-out with anti-gaming measures, the UX screen map is detailed enough to start design work, and the MVP scoping is realistic. Main weaknesses: the Brain Z-Score claims need clinical validation caveats, there's no pricing/business model section, and it lacks a competitive analysis. With those additions and a 1-page executive summary up front, this is ready for investor decks.",
  "improvements": [
    "Add a 1-page executive summary at the top with key metrics, ask amount, and value proposition",
    "Add competitive landscape section (Wellable, Virgin Pulse, Noom, ClassDojo wellness) with differentiation matrix",
    "Add pricing model: per-seat SaaS + hardware lease/purchase options with target price points",
    "Caveat Brain Z-Score claims — note that gym-environment EEG is experimental and MVP simulates this metric",
    "Add hardware BOM estimate and unit economics (cost per installation site)",
    "Add accessibility section: ADA compliance for physical activities, screen reader support for dashboards"
