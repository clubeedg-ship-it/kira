## 1. Framework for SaaS/Hardware Hybrid Projections {#1-framework}

### Why Hybrid Is Different
ZenithCred has two revenue streams with very different profiles:
- **Hardware (light panels + biofeedback devices):** Lumpy, upfront revenue; higher COGS; inventory risk
- **SaaS/Platform (gamification tokens, dashboard, analytics):** Recurring revenue; high gross margin; churn risk

**The golden rule:** Model them separately, then consolidate.

### Recommended Model Structure (5 Sheets)

| Sheet | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| **Assumptions** | All key drivers in one place (pricing, growth rates, churn, headcount, CAC). Toggle scenarios here. |
| **Revenue** | Hardware units sold × ASP + SaaS MRR buildup (new customers − churned × ARPU). Monthly Y1–Y2, quarterly Y3–Y5. |
| **Expenses** | COGS (hardware BOM, shipping, fulfillment) + OpEx (salaries, marketing, R&D, G&A). |
| **P&L / Cash Flow** | Consolidated income statement + cash flow. Show burn rate and runway explicitly. |
| **Dashboard** | Summary KPIs, charts, scenario toggle (base / bull / bear). Investor-facing. |

### Bottom-Up Approach (Seed-Appropriate)
At seed stage, top-down TAM-to-revenue is unconvincing. Instead:
1. **Start with sales capacity:** How many demos/month can you run? What's the close rate?
2. **Derive customers:** Demos × close rate = new customers/month
3. **Derive revenue:** Customers × (hardware ASP + monthly SaaS fee)
4. **Layer in churn and expansion** from Month 6+
5. **Validate against comparable growth rates** (see Section 3)

### Scenario Analysis
Build three scenarios sharing the same structure but different assumptions:

| Scenario | Y1 Revenue | Y3 Revenue | Key Difference |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Bear** | 60% of base | 50% of base | Slower sales cycle, higher churn |
| **Base** | — | — | Your best-guess assumptions |
| **Bull** | 140% of base | 180% of base | Faster adoption, lower churn, upsell |

## 2. Key Metrics Investors Expect {#2-key-metrics}

### Must-Have Metrics for Seed Deck

| Metric | What It Shows | Target Range |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Monthly Burn Rate** | Cash spent per month | €40–80K post-hire (for €1.1M raise) |
| **Runway** | Months of cash remaining | 14–18 months (raise should give you this) |
| **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost) | Cost to acquire one B2B client | €2,000–8,000 for SME; €10,000–25,000 for enterprise |
| **LTV** (Lifetime Value) | Total revenue from one customer over lifetime | Should be ≥3× CAC |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | Efficiency of growth spend | ≥3:1 (good), ≥5:1 (excellent) |
| **CAC Payback Period** | Months to recoup acquisition cost | <12 months ideal at seed |
| **Gross Margin** | Revenue − COGS / Revenue | Hardware: 40–55%; SaaS: 70–85%; Blended: 55–70% |
| **MRR / ARR** | Monthly/Annual recurring revenue | Show trajectory, not just snapshot |
| **Logo Churn** | % of customers lost per month | <2% monthly / <20% annual for B2B |
| **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)** | Expansion − contraction − churn | >100% = growing without new sales |
| **Unit Economics** | Per-deal profitability | Positive contribution margin by Y2 |

### What Investors Really Look For at Seed
1. **Credible path to €1M+ ARR** within 18–24 months
2. **Clear use of funds** tied to milestones (not vague "growth")
3. **Burn rate discipline** — not too lean (can't execute), not too lavish
4. **Assumptions you can defend** — every number should have a "why"

| **Hardware ASP** (per installation) | €3,000 | €5,000 | €8,000 | Light panels + biofeedback kit per office/floor |
| **Hardware COGS** | 55% of ASP | 50% of ASP | 40% of ASP | Improves with volume |
| **SaaS monthly fee** (per client) | €300/mo | €500/mo | €800/mo | Platform + gamification + analytics |
| **New clients/month (Y1)** | 1–2 | 2–3 | 3–5 | Ramp from 0 to target by Q3 |
| **New clients/month (Y3)** | 5–8 | 8–12 | 12–20 | With dedicated sales team |

| **Hardware inventory** | €10–20K | €15–30K | Lumpy — order ahead of deals |
| **Total burn** | €50–80K | €80–130K | |

### Comparable Benchmarks
- **B2B SaaS median time to €1M ARR:** 24–36 months from founding
- **Seed-stage B2B startups median monthly burn:** €40–80K (EU)
- **Employee wellness ROI for buyers:** 2:1 to 6:1 (use in sales pitch)
- **Per-employee savings from wellness programs:** ~€400–450/year (supports pricing justification)
