## Email 1 · Cold Intro — Value Proposition

**Subject:** Natural skincare your clients will ask about by name, {{first_name}}

Hi {{first_name}},

I came across {{company_name}} and was impressed by your commitment to {{personalization_note — e.g., "holistic wellness" / "curated beauty brands"}}. I think there's a natural fit with what we're building at Abura Cosmetics.

We create plant-based, certified-organic skincare formulated in the Netherlands — designed specifically for businesses like yours that refuse to compromise on ingredient quality. Every product is free from parabens, sulphates, and synthetic fragrances.

**Why spas and retailers partner with us:**

- **High-margin product line** — wholesale pricing that protects your margins while offering clients premium quality
- **Clean-label transparency** — full ingredient traceability your clients increasingly demand
- **Dutch-formulated, EU-certified** — compliant, locally produced, short supply chain

We're selectively expanding our wholesale network across the Netherlands and would love to explore whether Abura is the right fit for {{company_name}}.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call this week to discuss partnership options?

Warm regards,

## Email 2 · Follow-Up — Social Proof & Product Highlights

**Subject:** Why {{peer_company}} switched to Abura (and saw 30% repeat purchases)

Hi {{first_name}},

I reached out last week about a potential wholesale partnership — just wanted to share a quick update that might be relevant for {{company_name}}.

Our three best-selling lines for spa and retail partners:

🌿 **Shea & Baobab Body Collection** — Rich, African-inspired formulas that clients repurchase at 2× the rate of conventional alternatives  
🌿 **Daily Glow Facial Range** — Lightweight, suitable for all skin types — a consistent top seller at checkout  
🌿 **Ritual Oils** — Premium positioning that elevates any treatment menu or retail shelf

Partners across the Netherlands are reporting **30–40% repeat purchase rates** within 90 days of stocking Abura — well above the industry average for natural skincare.

We also provide complimentary POS materials, product training for your team, and a dedicated account manager to ensure smooth onboarding.

I'd love to walk you through our wholesale catalogue and pricing tiers. Would {{day_suggestion}} work for a quick call?

## Email 4 · Case Study / Testimonial Angle

**Subject:** How {{case_study_company}} added €4,200/month with one product line

Hi {{first_name}},

I wanted to share a quick story that might resonate with your situation at {{company_name}}.

**{{case_study_company}}**, a {{case_study_type — e.g., "boutique wellness spa in Amsterdam"}}, started stocking Abura six months ago. Here's what happened:

📈 **Month 1:** Introduced Abura to treatment rooms and retail shelf — immediate client interest  
📈 **Month 3:** Repeat orders increased 35%; clients specifically requesting Abura products  
📈 **Month 6:** Abura now represents their #2 retail revenue line — averaging **€4,200/month** in additional sales

*"Abura was exactly what our clients were asking for — clean, luxurious, and results-driven. The margins are excellent and the brand practically sells itself."*  
— **{{testimonial_name}}**, {{testimonial_title}}, {{case_study_company}}

We're seeing similar results across wellness centres and boutique retailers throughout the Netherlands.

I believe {{company_name}} could see comparable outcomes. Can I send over a tailored wholesale proposal this week?

Just hit reply and I'll have it in your inbox within 24 hours.

Best,

## Email 5 · Final Nudge — Urgency & Exclusivity

**Subject:** Last note — exclusive territory for {{city_or_region}} closing soon

Hi {{first_name}},

This is my final note — I respect your time and inbox.

I wanted to let you know that we're finalising our **exclusive retail and spa partnerships** for {{city_or_region}} this quarter. To maintain brand value, we limit wholesale accounts to **one partner per postal area** — and your area is still available.

**What exclusivity means for you:**

- **No local competition** stocking the same Abura line
- **Priority access** to new product launches and seasonal collections
- **Enhanced margins** — exclusive partners receive our best pricing tier
- **Co-marketing support** — social media features, in-store events, and PR inclusion

Once we assign this territory, it's off the table for other businesses in your area.

If there's any interest in exploring this — even just a preliminary conversation — I'd love to hear from you before we move forward with other candidates in {{city_or_region}}.

**Reply to this email or book a call here:** {{booking_link}}

Either way, I wish {{company_name}} continued success. Thank you for your time throughout this sequence.

Warmly,
